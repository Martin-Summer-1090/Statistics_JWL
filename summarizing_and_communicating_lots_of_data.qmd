# Summarizing and communicating lots of data

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Overview

1. In this chapter we will learn how to summarize and communicate lots of data. Most
   datasets you will be working with in statistics are large and can contain thousands or
   even millions of observations. To understand these data and their pattern of
   variation you need tools to summarize them in a meaningful and important way. In this
   chapter you will learn the tools to do so.

2. We first discuss a graphical tool to summarize the variation in a single variable by
   organizing the data in a way that shows us a global picture of the distribution of these
   data. This tool is called a **histogram** and you will encounter it very often across
   all applied data work and across all of statistics. To get a good understanding how to
   construct and work with a histogram, we first work with an example you can in principle
   do without a computer. This is useful to understand the basic principles of constructing
   and reading a histogram.

3. For larger datasets, which will be the usual case in practice, you will need to learn
   how to summarize and communicate the information about variables with lost of different
   values using the computer. This means in particular, that you need to understand how
   to read large datafiles from a given source, how to select and modify particular variables.
   You will thus learn some powerful tools from the R language that will help you to
   do so.
   
4. You will also learn to summarize large datasets by single numbers that provide information
   about the central tendency of the values of a variable. The **mean** is such a number, used
   over and over in statistics. You will learn what a mean is, what it tells you and when
   it gives a meaningful summary about the central tendency of a dataset.

5. For a summary of a large dataset by numbers, you need not only an idea of at which values
   of a variable the data are centered but also how much they are spread out around this value.
   Such a measure of spread is the **standard deviation**. Like the mean understanding and 
   working with standard deviations is fundamental and will be encountered over and over
   again throughout the large field of statistics and applied work with data. You need
   to gain a good understanding of what the standard deviation is and how to compute it.


When you have worked through this unit you will be able to summarize large datasets
graphically and numerically and understand what these measures tell you about the
variation in the data, how they look like, what are the most typical values of the variables
and how much they are spread out around these values. In this process you will power up
your abilities to read, select and manipulate large data files and single variables using the
R language. This will enlarge your abilities to work with data by a huge and important step.

When we analyze data, we usually have to look at lots of them. As a leading example,
let us take the case of anthropometric data. These are data measuring height and weight
of humans in a population.^[Anthropometry (This is a word with roots from ancient greek. 
In ancient greek anthropos means 'human', and métron means 'measure'. Anthropometry thus 
refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of physical 
anthropology, it has been used for identification, for the 
purposes of understanding human physical variation]. These data are usually gathered via
large population survey like the Demographic and Health Survey abbreviated DHS^[The DHS 
program, a US based program on demographics and health in various parts of the 
developing world. The data are used to monitor demographic and health 
developments to decide where policy action might be needed. The DHS website 
can be found here: https://dhsprogram.com/ ] 

What's the point of recording the height and
weight of humans? 
First of all, human growth depends on good nutrition and the 
availability of medical services to 
effectively treat illness. Thus human height in a population has for a long time been
a subject of study. The average human height in a population varies with the general 
living standards. This fact makes data on human height especially interesting
for historians who study the history of living conditions. 
Because humans tend to get taller when
they have good living conditions, human height can reveal some information 
on living conditions, height
data can be an indirect measure of living conditions. This is especially interesting for
periods when very little or no data were collected and recorded.

But also tody information about the distribution of height and weight in a 
population enables countries 
to make data-driven decisions and to monitor their progress in improving 
nutritional status and achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.^[
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection 
of seventeen interlinked objectives designed to serve as a "shared blueprint for peace 
and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future." 
The goals were set and decided by the 
United Nations General Assembly and are monitored through various data collection 
efforts, including the DHD. The short titles of the 17 SDGs are: No poverty (SDG 1), 
Zero hunger (SDG 2), Good health and well-being (SDG 3),
Quality education (SDG 4), Gender equality (SDG 5), 
Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), 
Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), 
Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), 
Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), 
Reduced inequalities (SDG 10), Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), 
Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), 
Climate action (SDG 13), Life below water (SDG 14), Life on land (SDG 15), 
Peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG 16), Partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).
See also the website: https://sdgs.un.org/goals]
The measurement of human height and weight are also important in the history of statistics.
Especially important concepts describing the statistical relation between two variables,
were detected in this context. We will learn about these concepts later, when we study the
statistical tool of regression.

We will use a dataset from the DHS later in this chapter, when we discuss how to
use R to deal with large datasets. The number of observations in this case is 2559. This
is not very big but certainly too big to reasonably handle by hand. With a 
computer this becomes realistic. 

But before we do so, lets look at a smaller example and do some anthropometry of
our own study group for this course.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Seitwerk: Expand for reading comment.
Reda, I think it would be great that among the activities in the study center we collect
some data about the students in the group. I would suggest height, weight. These
varibles can be measured and recorded and the students could be asked to store these
data in a text file, sow e can read them by R here. We could then
use these data here to explain how a histogram is constructed.
:::

### Constructing a Histogram

To summarize data, statisticians often use a graph which is called a **histogram**. 
In this section we will discuss all you have to know about histograms and how to use them.

Since real world examples in this exposition come from anthropomentry, let us 
look at a sample of 100 observations from a set of real world data about human adults
of age 18 and above, where the data record their height in cm.^[These data are collected from
the internet. For details you can look at the source at http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_Dinov_020108_HeightsWeights]
```{r}
library(JWL)
dat <- socr_height_weight
dat$Height <- dat$Height*2.54

set.seed(1)
heights <- sample(x = dat$Height, size = 100) # randomly select 100 values without replacement.
heights
```
This is how R prints out the 100 height values. You already learned what the numbers in
brackets on the left side mean. They are counters or observations. In total we have
100 values.

We start the construction of a histogram by choosing for the horizontal 
axes ranges of numerical
values - in our case of the height data - which are called *bins* or *classes*. There is no
fixed rule as to how to choose the size of these ranges. These ranges should neither be too 
fine, nor too
coarse. While there are lists of mechanical rules, which you 
can for example find on Wikipedia^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width], it is 
usually best to use your domain
knowledge and some experimentation to find out the bin size that works best for your data.

For this example, assume we had chosen a bin size of 5 cm. When you study 
the list, you will find that the lowest value is at 160.12 cm  while the highest value
is at 185.16. This is already quite tedious to find out by 
eyeballing the numbers with the small 
number of values we have chosen for this example. 
It is impossible to do for really large data sets.

Now lets make a distribution table like this:

| Height-bin | Frequency |
|-----------:|----------:|
| 160 -  165 |          7|
| 165 -  170 |         20|
| 170 -  175 |         39|
| 175 -  180 |         28|
| 180 -  185 |          5|
| 185 -  190 |          1|


In the column Height-bin we have recorded the bins in steps of 5 and in the right 
column, Frequency, we have recorded the count of values that are in this bin. 

When we make such a tabulation we have to agree on an endpoint convention. 
This is important, since 
when a height value would for instance be measured as exactly 165, in which bin 
should it be counted:
160-165 or 165-170? You, the constructor of the histogram, has to take this decision. Let us
agree on the convention that when a value falls exactly at the endpoint of the bin, we
put it in the next bin. In practice you
will usually do a histogram by computer. 
The code of the computer program has to specify an endpoint
convention, so the computer knows what to do when a value coincides with an endpoint.

On the Frequency axes you put the frequency scale: Counts of values. 
Then for each bin, you plot
a bar, which has the width of the bin and the height of the frequency. 
Do this for all the bins
you have tabulated and you are ready.

The histogram provides a certain aggregation of the data because it sorts 
the 100 data points into 6
bins, in our example. While loosing some local information on 
individual data points the global information
conveyed by the summary gives us a pretty good idea of the overall 
pattern of variation on the Nile river
flow data. 

We can see, for instance, that the most frequent height is between 170 and 175 and that the
variation is fairly symmetric around this bin. In the extremes this most frequent 
value can half or shrink even more, so there is quite some spread in the data.

Reda, I think it would be great if you could do some animation that reproduces the 
steps: Plot a hight axiss with bins from 160 t0 190 in bin sizes of 5, then plot a frequency
axes from 0 to 40 in steps of 10. Them from the list of 100 numbers, collect all that are
recorded in the first bin and then make the hight proportional to the count, then the next
etc. 
The idea would be to realize someting like my previous sketch for the Nile data
![Constructing the river flow histogram](pictures/nile_hist.png)
:::

If we had just plotted all individual data points, we also got a picture like this.

```{r}
plot(as.numeric(heights), xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Height in cm", pch = 16)
```

You will agree that as a summary of the data it is not particularly useful and not
as informative as the histogram.

Histograms are such a common tool in statistics to explore the variation 
in one variable and the shape, how
it is roughly distributed that every statistical software has functions 
to produce histograms. 

In R, the
language we use in this course, there is also such a function. 
The function name is called `hist()` and it
takes the data as an argument. This is the second graphic function 
of R you encounter in this course
after we played with the `barplot()`function in the last lecture. 

To produce a histogram from the height data with R, we type at the console

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hist(heights)
```

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try

Let us check your understanding of histograms by a little quiz now. The histogram below
shows the distribution of the final score in a certain class.

(a) Which block represents the people who scored between 60 and 80?
(b) Ten percent scored between 20 and 40 about what percentage scored between 40 and 60?
(c) About what percentage scored over 60?

Reda, I think it would be great if you could redo the graphics with
computer. I have these hand drawn graphs only because I did not have
enough time to play around with computer graphics and because I
wanted to experiment how such pictures would look like. I think
a computer graph would be better.
:::

### The relative frequency scale: Absolute versus relative frequency

Sometimes it might be useful, to choose a different scale for the y axes of 
your histogram. Instead
of absolute frequencies (or counts) it might be useful to show relative 
frequencies, the proportion
of occurrences in each bin. The type of scale you choose will depend on what kind of 
comparisons you want to emphasize about your data.

Assume you would want to draw your histogram such that on the y-axis you do not
see the absolute counts of how many individuals in your data fell into a certain
hight bin but you want to see instead these numbers as a percentage of the whole
dataset. 

This is sometimes convenient and in some cases more informative. This choice of
a different scale is called the **relative-frequency-scale**. The construction
of the histogram follows the same principles as we have already discussed but now
we just quantify the counts in the bins differently as shares of all observations.

Let's do the histogram for the heights data in a relative frequency scale. In
our table, which we used to construct the histogram before we had in total
100 observations. A count of 7 is therefore 7 % or 0.07 in the relative frequency
scale etc. Thus our table would now be:

| Height-bin | Frequency |
|-----------:|----------:|
| 160 -  165 |       0.07|
| 165 -  170 |       0.20|
| 170 -  175 |       0.39|
| 175 -  180 |       0.28|
| 180 -  185 |       0.05|
| 185 -  190 |       0.01|

and the histogram in relative frequency scale would look like this:
```{r}
h<-hist(heights, plot=F)
h$counts <- h$counts / sum(h$counts)
plot(h, freq=TRUE, ylab="Relative Frequency")
axis(2, at = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4), labels = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4))
```

Unfortunately R has no standard argument to its `hist()`function to draw a
histogram with a relative frequency scale. To produce a histogram like shown
here we would need some more advanced coding than we know at the moment.^[The `hist()` function in R has an argument, called `freq`. It can take the value `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the
argument is set to `FALSE` the histogram is shown such that the y axis has yet another
scale, the so called density scale. This scale is chosen such that the total area of
the histogram is 1.]

### Best practices for histograms

When you summarize lots of data by a histogram there are some things you should 
consider carefully. Let us go through the most important best practice 
principles for histograms.

#### Bin size

When doing exploratory data work it is usually a good idea not to look at a single 
histogram but at several histograms of the same data by changing the bin size. There
is no clear rule about the optimal bin size. It often depends on context and field 
knowledge. 

If the bins are to fine, then the data will be be very noisy and give no overview because
they show too many individual points. On the other hand if the bins are too wide, they
will not show you the overall variability in the data very well and you fail to
get a good idea about the distribution. 

Let us illustrate this point using our heights data. 

In the first case we have chosen 100 bins, which is too fine. There is almost one bar
for every single data point. In this way we have a lot of spurious peaks and throughs and can
not see the variation pattern in the data very clearly

```{r}
hist(heights, breaks = seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 100))
```
Now here we have the other extreme, lets assume we have only 3 bins. This would give us
a pattern like this.

```{r}
hist(heights, breaks = seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 3))
```
Here the histogram is too coarse and we do not see the variation pattern either. 

The computer usually has a built in rule of thumb for the histogram 
which will work well in most
of the cases. Still for individual datasets it is sometimes better 
to choose a different bin size
that more adequately mirrors the variation in the data.

#### Choose boundaries that can be clearly interpreted

Tick marks and labels should fall on the bin boundaries. As in the examples discussed
so far, they need not be there for every tick but it is enough if they are there between
every few bars. Bin labels should also have not many significant digits, so they are easy to
read. So bin sized which divide 10 and 20 evenly are easier to read than bin sizes that do not.
So always take caution not to arbitrarily split bin sizes. Otherwise you can end up with
off bin boundaries.

For example, if we just took the maximum and the minimum of the heights data and
arbitrarily divided them into 7 bins, we would get the difficult to read bin boundaries

```{r}
seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 7)
```

instead of the more easily readable boundaries

```{r}
seq(160,190,5)
```

#### What's the difference between a histogram and a bar chart?

A histogram depicts the frequency distribution of a continuous, quantitative variable, such 
as height, weight, time, energy consumption etc. These are variables that can take on any
value and these values can be ordered from smallest to highest.

When we have a categorical variable, like we encountered them in section 2, 
we need to use a bar chart.
The bars of the bar chart typically will have a small gap between the bars, emphasizing 
the discrete
nature of the variable. The categories in a bar chart usually have no natural ordering. 
As we discussed
in section 2, we have even to be conscious how we display the categories to 
avoid suggesting an
order that is in fact not there in the data.

## The average and the standard deviation

With a histogram we can summarize a large amount of data and get some insights about the
variation in the data. Often we can summarize data much more drastically by just one number
describing the center of the histogram and the spread around this center. When I write center
an spread here, these are just ordinary words with no special technical meaning.

When we do statistics we need 
precise definitions and we will study and learn these definitions in this section. 
The **average** is
often used to find the center. Another measure to find 
the center is the **median**. The **standard** deviation measures spread around 
the average. The **interquartile range** is another measure of 
spreads.

Before we go into these definitions, let me show for a start 
two histograms, both have the same center, but the second one is more spread
out, there are more observations farther away from the center.

```{r}
#| include: false

set.seed(1)
dat1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 2)
dat2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 6)

png("pictures/example_histogram1.png")
hist(dat1, xlab = "", main = "", xlim = c(-20, 20), breaks = 30)
abline(v = mean(dat1),                       # Add line for mean
       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat1) + sd(dat1)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat1) - sd(dat1)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()

png("pictures/example_histogram2.png")
hist(dat2, xlab = "", main = "", xlim = c(-20, 20), breaks = 30)
abline(v = mean(dat2),                       # Add line for mean
       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat2)+ sd(dat2)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat2) - sd(dat2)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()
```

![Histogram 2](pictures/example_histogram2.png){#fig-ex-hist-2}

Histogram 1 and Histogram 2 have the same center but Histogram 2 is more spread out
:::

These distributions can be summarized by the center and the spread. But what about a situation like this?
```{r}
#| include: false 

mu1 <- log(0.03)   
mu2 <- log(50)
sig1 <- log(3)
sig2 <- log(2)
cpct <- 0.4

  y1 <- rlnorm(n,mean=mu2, sd = sig2)

  flag <- rbinom(n,size=1,prob=cpct)
  y <- y0*(1 - flag) + y1*flag 
}

bimodalData <- bimodalDistFunc(n=100000,cpct,mu1,mu2, sig1,sig2)

       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(log(bimodalData))+ sd(log(bimodalData))),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(log(bimodalData)) - sd(log(bimodalData))),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()
```


![A bimodal distribution](pictures/bimodal.png){#fig-ex-hist-bm}

In some cases such distribution can occur naturally. 
Think, for example, about the distribution of the elevation data of surface area of the earth.
Most of the surface area of the earth is taken by the sea floor at about three 
miles below the sea level 
or the continental planes around sea level. If we would report only the center an the spread
of this histogram, plotted in the picture as the red and blue vertical lines, we would miss these peaks.

### The average

Let us stick to the height data, we have analyzed in a histogram before as the
context for which we study the concept of an average.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Average

The average of a list of numbers is defined as their sum, divided by how
many numbers their are in the list.

:::

For example the average of the list $L$

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
L <- c(9,1,2,2,0)
```

would be computed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{(9+1+2+2+0)}{5} = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8
\end{equation}

By now it will be no surprise for you that R provides a function for computing averages.
This function is known by the alternative name for the average, called the mean.

Here is how you would compute the mean using R.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(L)
```

which is indeed what we should get as a result.

Let's go back to the issue of human height data and take our data set of
100 observations of the height of adult humans. Let us recall
our histogram and give it some nice title and a precise label for the
x-axis:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hist(heights, xlab = "Height in cm", main = "Height of 18 year old humans")
```

The distribution looks symmetric. If we summarize these data by taking an average in one number
we will capture the center of the distribution fairly well. 
Let us compute the average, using the
mean function. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
average_height <- mean(heights)
average_height
```

The average height in this dataset is about `r average_height`  cm. 
The average is a very powerful way of
communicating data by compressing many observations into one single
number, the mean. 

This compression is, however, only achieved by loosing some 
information on individual differences.
For example in our dataset the average height is `r average_height` cm. 
But there are about  % who are larger than
 and there are also about 4 % who are smaller than . With 100 individuals these are
 individuals who are beyond these thresholds. This diversity is hidden in the aggregation.

This is a good opportunity to show you a cool feature or trick in R how we could in one line
compute such percentages. Assume we want to compute the percentage of individuals in our data
who are larger than the mean of `r average_height`. How can we do this?

Logicals are a powerful data type to make such a computation. Say we have 10 numbers, given by

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x <- c(4,5,1,2,4,2,0,10,11,6)
```

Now we could ask R which entries of x are larger than 2 by typing

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x > 2
```

The output is a vector of logicals where R compares each entry in `x`with 2 and if it is larger it 
returns `TRUE` and otherwise `FALSE` (this includes all entries which are exactly 2). 

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

Replace every `TRUE` value with 1 and every `FALSE` value with 0 and compute the mean.
What do you get? Compute the percentage of values in `x`which are larger than 2. What did you get?
Explain!

:::

Note that, when you apply the function `mean()` to a vector of data of type logical the coercion rules
of R will coerce TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0 automatically. So if you apply `mean()` to `x` you will
get the result you have computed before.

This insight can be used to compute the percentage of values that fulfill a certain condition in R.
Here the condition is that the Height is larger than the mean.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

Compute the percentage of Heights in `dat` which are larger and the
percentage of Heights that are smaller than the mean of 172.7025.

:::

```{r}
mean(dat$Height > 172.7025)
mean(dat$Height < 172.7025)
```

The value of a distribution where 50 % of all values are larger than this given value and 50
% are smaller is another one number summary you can give for a large set of data which describes
the center of a distribution in another way. It is called the median. R also has a built in
function for the median, which is called - as you might already guess - `median()`. Let us compute
the median height in our data.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

median(dat$Height)
```

In this case the median and the mean give the same value up to the third digit. They are for 
practical reasons identical. The reason is that in the case of the measure of Height the distribution
is highly symmetric. In practice you will encounter many situations where the distribution of
a variable is not even approximately symmetric.

A typical case of a distribution that us typically not symmetric but skewed - as it is called 
in statistical terminology - is income. The following histogram which is scaled in
relative frequencies shows the data for the
global income distribution in the year 2013 as reported by two economists @HelMau2015 from the Peterson
Institute, a US based research institution.^[We have used the data they provide to
simulate a sample of 100.000 observations consisten with the numbers they report. Thus
our data used here are a simulation reproducing the characteristics of the data reported in 
this paper. We will soon learn how to do simulations using R. For the moment we need you to
trust that we have done this correctly.] The unit of measurement is US dollars in 
so called purchasing power parity, a concept economists use to make income 
figures comparable in terms of the amount
of goods they can buy.^[When reporting income figures we could translate all national figures gathered from around the world into one common currency (for instance, US dollars) using exchange rates from currency markets. But because market exchange rates do not always reflect the different price levels between countries, economists often opt for a different alternative. They create a hypothetical currency, called ‘international dollars’, and use this as a common unit of measure. The idea is that a given amount of international dollars should buy roughly the same amount – and quality – of goods and services in any country. This way of measuring monetary amounts is called dollars in purchasing power parity or PPP.]

inc$Percent <- as.numeric(unlist(inc$Percent))

inc_trunc <- inc$Income[inc$Income<=14000]

data <- sample(inc_trunc, 10^5, replace = TRUE, prob = inc$Percent[0:701])

hist(data, breaks = 27, xlab = "Income in purchasing parity power dollars", main = "Global income distribution")
```
Now the mean and the median of these data would give us:

```{r}
mean(data)
median(data)
```

There is a big difference in both numbers as you can see even better when we show the mean (red line) and the median (blue) income value of our data in the graph.

```{r}
hist(data, breaks = 27, xlab = "Income in purchasing parity power dollars", main = "Global income distribution")
abline(v = mean(data),                       # Add red line for mean
       col = "red")
abline(v = median(data),                     # Add blue line for median
       col = "blue")

```

When the distribution is not symmetric the mean does not capture the center of the distribution well. 
We have stored the data of our histogram in an object we have chosen to call `data`. Let us verify
that the median is actually the value above that is in the middle of all values and compare this
with the mean for these skewed distribution.

Let's check the median first

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(data > 1700)
mean(data < 1700)
```

Now let us do the same check for the mean

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(data > 3012.174)
mean(data < 3012.174)

```

You see that the mean now does not capture the center of the distribution well. Only 32 % have incomes
above the mean income and 68 % have incomes below. The point where 50% are above and 50 % are below is 
actually at 1700, as expressed by the median.

There is another important difference between the mean and the median. 

Do this with the income distribution example.

### The standard deviation

When summarizing and communicating lots of data, it is useful not only to report 
at which value the center of the distribution is. It is often helpful to also 
think about the way how the values spread around the average. The quantity which
measures this spread is called the standard deviation. It can be interpreted as 
an average deviation. In this section you will learn to interpret the standard
deviation in the context of real data and then learn how it is computed both
by hand and by using the computer.

Le us go back to our data on the height of 18 year old humans. There were 25.000 observations
in our sample. The average height was
```{r}
mean(dat$Height)
```
This average tells us that most of the humans measured in the sample had a height of
around 1 m and 73 cm. But there were deviations from this average. Some humans were
taller and others were smaller. We can ask how big these deviations are? In answering 
this question we need the concept of the standard deviation.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Standard deviation

The standard deviation says how far away numbers on a list are from their
average. Most entries on the list will usually be somewhat around one
standard deviation from the average. Very few will be more than two or three
standard deviations away.

:::

In R you can compute the standard deviation by using the function `sd()`. So let us
compute the standard deviation of our height data using the `sd()`function.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

sd(dat$Height)
```

So the standard deviation is at about 4.8 cm. That means that many humans differed from the
average height by about 1, 2, 3, 4 or about 5 cm. Let us use R to compute the percent
of observation that are within one standard deviation from the average. 

Let us use the trick of combining logical subsetting and the coercion rules of R to
compute this percentage here:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

aux <- dat$Height >= mean(dat$Height) - sd(dat$Height) & dat$Height <= mean(dat$Height) + sd(dat$Height)

mean(aux)

```
Let me explain what we have computed here. First we have checked for all the entries in 
the vector `dat$Height` whether they were larger than the average minus one standard deviation and
smaller than the average plus one standard deviation. These are all the values that are within
one standard deviation away from the average. For all values that are in this range R returns the
value `TRUE` and for all the other values that are outside of this range, R returns the value `FALSE`.
We have stored the vector recording all these logical values in a new object called `aux`.
Now we computed the mean of aux. When the mean function of R gets a vector of logical values it
coerces all the `TRUE` values to 1 and al the `FALSE` values to 0. When we take the mean we get the
share of values for which the condition is TRUE. In our case this is around 68 %. The other 32 % are
farther away. 

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

1. Compute the percentage of observations of our height data that are within 
   two standard deviations from the average.

2. Compute the percentage of observations of our height data that are within 
   three standard deviations from the average.

:::

This is a rule of thumb that applies to many (but not all) data sets. For many distributions
roughly 68 % of observations are within one standard deviation from the average. 95 % are within
two standard deviations from the average and 99.7 % are within three standard deviations 
from the average. There is a deeper mathematical reason why this rule applies to 
many symmetric distributions. For the moment we can 
use this information as a sort of rile of thumb for symmetric, bell shaped
distributions. We will learn later in the course where this rule
comes from. Let us illustrate the rules graphically using the histogram.

```{r}
#| include: false
hist_breaks <- hist(dat$Height, plot = FALSE)$breaks
color_list <- rep('#C6E2FF', length(hist_breaks))
color_list[hist_breaks <= mean(dat$Height) + sd(dat$Height)] <- '#6C7B8B'
color_list[hist_breaks <= mean(dat$Height) - sd(dat$Height)] <- '#C6E2FF'
```

```{r}
hist(dat$Height, col = color_list, xlab = "Height in cm", main = "Height of 18 year old humans")
abline(v = mean(dat$Height),                       # Add red line for mean
       col = "red")
```


The next figure shows the same histogram. Now the area within two standard deviations from
the mean is colored differently

```{r}
#| include: false
hist_breaks <- hist(dat$Height, plot = FALSE)$breaks
color_list <- rep('#C6E2FF', length(hist_breaks))
color_list[hist_breaks <= mean(dat$Height) + 2*sd(dat$Height)] <- '#6C7B8B'
color_list[hist_breaks <= mean(dat$Height) - 2*sd(dat$Height)] <- '#C6E2FF'

```

```{r}
hist(dat$Height, col = color_list, xlab = "Height in cm", main = "Height of 18 year old humans")
abline(v = mean(dat$Height),                       # Add red line for mean
       col = "red")
```

Let us note a final point about this rule of thumb for symmetric distribution, you
frequently encounter in practice. Often it is common to report a distribution of
a variable not in its orginal units - height in cm - for example but in a standardized
form where the units are changed such that the mean is at 0 and the standard deviation is
at 1.

How is this possible? Let us consider the following example.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example

Consider the following 10 values, which we write into a vector $x$ and compute its mean
$\mu$ and its standard deviation $\sigma$:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x <- c(9,14,9,11,11,10,15,8,11,13)

mean(x)
sd(x)
```
Thus $\mu = 11.1$ and $\sigma = 2.282786$. Now let us change the units according to the
formula
\begin{equation*}
z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation*}
and compute the mean of $z_i$ and its standard deviation. We can use R to do that:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
z <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)

mean(z)
sd(z)
```
Now you see that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. The mean in the R computation is not exactly 0, but this comes from the rounding errors made by the computer. For practical purposed $1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ is as good as zero. This must be the case as a 
consequence of how we changed the units. The mathematically inclined among you might
try to derive this fact more generally using the definition of the mean and the standard
deviation.

Now see what happens when we standardize our height data
```{r}
#|code-fold: false

dat$Z <- (dat$Height - mean(dat$Height))/sd(dat$Height)
```
We want to see how many of the transformed values fall within 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviations or three standard deviations from the mean.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

check1 <- dat$Z >= mean(dat$Z) - sd(dat$Z) & dat$Z <= mean(dat$Z) + sd(dat$Z)
check2 <- dat$Z >= mean(dat$Z) - 2*sd(dat$Z) & dat$Z <= mean(dat$Z) + 2*sd(dat$Z)
check3 <- dat$Z >= mean(dat$Z) - 3*sd(dat$Z) & dat$Z <= mean(dat$Z) + 3*sd(dat$Z)

mean(check1)
mean(check2)
mean(check3)
```
:::

So the rule of thumb applies all the same: About 65 % of observations are within one
standard deviation from the mean, 95 % within 2 and 99.7 within three standard devaitions.
The transformation has only changed the units in which we measure our values not the
way they are distributed.


### Computing the standard deviation

Usually we will compute the standard deviation using the computer and only in rare cases will we
ever compute a standard deviation by hand. Still it is important that you understand how the
computation works and what is actually been computed. Here is how.

Example 1: Find the standard deviation of the list 20, 10, 15, 15

Step 1: We first need to find the average, which is
\begin{equation}
\frac{20 + 10 + 15 + 15}{4} = 15
\end{equation}

Step 2: We next need to find the deviation from the average. In order to do so, we just subtract
the average from each entry
\begin{eqnarray}
(20-15)&=5\\
(10-15)&=&-5\\
(15-15)&=&0\\
(15-15)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}

Step 3: Now we have to square each one of these differences and take the square root, which is 
often called the root mean square

\begin{eqnarray}
sd&=&\sqrt{\frac{5^2 + (-5)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}{4}} \\
 &=& \sqrt{\frac{25 + 25 + 0 + 0}{4}} \\
 &=& \sqrt{\frac{50}{4}}\\
 &=& \sqrt{12.4}\\
 &\approx& 3.5
\end{eqnarray}

The standard deviation has the same units as the data. For example, when we measure height in cm then at the squaring step the units change to $cm^2$ but the suqre root returns $cm$ again. 

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

1. Guess which of the following two lists has the larger standard deviation. Check your
guess by computing the standard deviation for both lists.

(i) 9,9,10,10,12
(i) 7,8,10,11,11,13

2. Can the standard deviation ever be negative?

3. For a list of positive numbers can the standard deviation ever be larger than the
average?

## Summary




## Summarizing and communicationg large datasets using the computer: Taking the next steps in R {#sec-moreR}

Anthropometric data can help a country to get a data driven picture on the nutritional status
of its population. These data can help identify areas where policy action is needed. Since
real world data sets, which will usually come from surveys, will be too large to be
handles manually. For these datasets you need to be able to work with the computer.

We will now learn these skills using data from the DHS survey. DHS is an abbreviation 
for Demographic and Health Survey) program, a US based program on demographics and 
health in various parts of the developing world. The data are used 
to monitor demographic and health developments to decide where policy action 
might be needed.

The data we are using are not from an actual survey but they are from a 
synthetic model dataset provided by the DHS for teaching and training. 
But they reflect realistic values and could come form an actual country
survey. The DHS website can be found here: https://dhsprogram.com/ and the 
raw model data sets can be found here https://dhsprogram.com/data/model-datasets.cfm

Before we go into the details of the data we need a bit of context to understand 
what the data we are looking at here are precisely describing. In the 
analysis we are going to produce a statistical table on the nutritional 
status of children under five years.

Anthropometry provides data on the human body and reveals information about a 
persons nutritional status. The nutritional status of children is observed to 
monitor and measure malnutrition in a population. The nutritional 
data of children are included in the United Nations development goals indicators.

The DHS survey collects data on children's sex, age, height-length, and weight to 
monitor the nutritional status of children in a population. The nutritional 
indicators are sex and age specific because boys and girls grow at different rates. 
Their growth rates are also age dependent.

Four indicators on nutritional status are collected in DHS surveys:

(a) Overweight: This indicates high weight for height and is a measure of excess weight. 
This results from an imbalance of energy consumed (too much) and energy 
expended (too little). Children with this condition have an increased risk of 
non-communicable diseaeses, such as hight blood pressure and diabetes and is 
associcated with increased risk of being obese and overweight in adulthood.

(b) Stunting: This is low height-for-age. It is a measure of growth faltering and may result from a deficient growth environment, recurrent infections, chronic deseases and other causes. It is associated with impaired brain development and reduced academic achievement in childhood and lower economic potential as an adult.

(c) Wasting: Is low weight-for-height and is a measure of acute weight loss. This may result from inadequate food intake or from illness or infection. With this condition children are more susceptible for disease and have a higher risk of death.

(d) Underweight: Is low weight-for-age and is a measure of weight relative to a child's age. It refects children who are stunted or wasted or both.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) child growth standards provide a single 
international standard that describes the physiological growth for all children 
from birth to age 5. The measurements of individual children are compared 
to the WHO Child Growth Standards to assess each child's growth. The WHO 
Growth Standards for children use a distribution that is expressed in units of 
standard deviations from the mean, also called z-scores. It is a distribution 
with a mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Within 1 standard deviation are 
about 67 % of all values, within 2 95 % and within 3 standard deviations 99.7%. 
Height for age, weight for height, and weight for age of children are expressed 
in these units.

Statistical cutoffs are used to measure malnutriton. If a child's height 
for age is below minus two standard deviations from the 
mean (expressed in z-scores), the child is considered stunted. If it is 
below minus three standard deviations from the mean it is considered severely 
stunted. If the weight-for-height z-score is below minus 2 standard 
deviations from the mean the child is considered wasted, if it is below 
three standard deviations from the mean it is considered severely wasted. 
If the weight for height z-score is above two standard deviations from 
the mean the child is considered overweight, if three standard deviations 
above it is considered obese. If the weight for height z-score of a child 
is below two standard deviations from the mean it is considered underweight, if 
three, severely underweight.

The WHO uses the following prevalence thresholds to assess the problems of 
stunting and wasting in a population of children:



|Classification|stunting         |wasting and overweight |
|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------------|
|very high     |	30% or more	   | 15 % or more          |
|high	         | 20 - 29 %	     | 10 - 14 %             |
|medium	       | 10 - 19 %	     |  5 - 9 %              |
|low	         |  2.5 - 9 %	     |  2.5 - 4 %            |
|very low	     | Less than 2.5 % | Less than 2.5 %       |

: WHO Prevalence thresholds for height and weight {.striped .hover}

Prevalence is the proportion of a population who have a specific characteristic 
in a given time period. In a survey prevalence is measured by the number of 
people in a sample who have the characteristic divided by all people in the sample.

Before we go on with learning the tools to summarize and communicate lots of data let us
gain more skills for handling the tool that will actually enable you to handle
large data sets yourself by making use of R. Building on what we learned in the last unit, 
lets now push
your knowledge of R bit further.

### Reading data in R {#sec-readingdata}

Before we can do anything with data, we need first to learn how  to load data into R and how
to save them. We will discuss now how to do this for the case of *comma separated text files* or 
so called *csv* files. R provides functions 
for reading and writing from almost any other format, like data stored in
Excel files and many more data formats that are used today.
Since in all those different formats are read by R following the same principles 
as in the csv case, it is sufficient if we discuss here the the case of csv files only.

We have discussed a data set of per capita primary energy use in countries around the globe to
produce a histogram of these data for the year 2019. How did I get these data into R?

First of all I could access these data because helpful people at Oxford University in the UK who maintain
and run the website "Our world in data", which we have encountered before, store these data on their
website. In the concrete case of the energy data, they can currently be found at
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use
where you can download the datafile from the webpage and save it locally somewhere on your
computer. 

I have taken a screenshot here

![Our World in Data website energy](pictures/our_world_in_data_energy.png)

In the lower right corner you see a box called Data and a download button. This button allows you to 
download the dataset to your machine. The file is called `per-capita-energy-use.csv`. From the extension
of the file `csv`, you can see that it is a comma separated text file. This is a plain text file following
certain formatting rules. In particular individual data points are separated by a comma^[The standard format for csv can be looked up here https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt. Despite this standardization
it can occur that different files use different conventions for the notation of the decimal comma sign. In the most common specification this symbols is a dot (.) and in others it is a comma (,). For such speical cases R provides special functions, which we will explain in the text.]

I have stored
the file in a sub-folder to the directory in which I am writing these lecture notes. If you decide to
download this file, you will save it somewhere on your machine where you find it appropriate. Perhaps
you have a folder for this course and in this folder you have a sub-folder where you store all the
data sets we are using in the course.

To read a csv file, R provides the function `read.csv()`. If the csv file
comes with a European instead of an US decimal format (`,` instead of `.` for the
decimal sign.) you need to use the function `read.csv2()`. Please check out the documentation
of these functions by typing `?read.csv` at the R prompt.

In the simplest form you read the data and store them in an object
you can work with in R. How to store data in an R object, we have already learned
in the previous lecture. You invent a name and assign the values to this name using the 
assignment operator `<-`.

Let's call the
object in which we save our data `energy_consumption`, then by calling the function `read.csv()` with the
path to your file as an argument will read the data from your local folder and store them in the
object we have created. This allows us to refer to the data for doing further computations.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
energy_consumption <- read.csv("data/energy_use_per_capita/per-capita-energy-use.csv")
```
The function needs as an argument the file name. If the file is in a sub-folder
of  the current directory you need to also specify the path.
To specify the correct path to the file
you need to know in which part of your directory tree you are currently working.

In my
case I am working in the project folder for my lecture notes, which has a sub-folder called
`data`. The data sub-folder has a further sub-folder called `energy_use_per_capita` in my case
and thus I specify the path relative to this location. 

To find out what is your current
R working directory, R provides the function `getwd()`. If I type this in my case, I will get
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
getwd()
```
the path of my project folder for this lecture notes. So if I type the string
`"data/energy_use_per_capita/per-capita-energy-use.csv"` this specifies the path relative to my working directory.

If you read the file on your computer, you need to specify the path appropriately from where
you are working in R at the moment to where you have stored the csv file.

Now `read.csv()` has many additional arguments, which provide you with lots of
flexibility. I encourage you to check it out and play with it using the help function and
the examples given therein by typing `?read.csv` at the prompt.

We have now read the primary energy consumption data and written it to the 
R-object `energy_consumption`. Lets
inspect the object a bit to see what we've got. 

I use the function `head()` with
the parameter value `n = 10`. This will show me the first 10 rows of the data-file.
So the value I give to the argument `n` contros how many rows will be displayed.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
options(width = 120)
head(energy_consumption, n = 10)
```
This gives you an idea what the data look like. There are four variables, called `Entity`, `Code`, `Year` and `Primary.energy.consumption.per.capita..kWh.person.` The last variable name is very informative
but also very long and unpractical. We will learn how to change variable names soon. Because of the
long name, I had to use the function `options()` before `heads()` to tell R to use a sufficiently wide
display. Don't worry for this detail at the moment.

### R objects {#sec-robjects}

The most basic type of R objects are **atomic vectors**. Objects in R are built
from atomic vectors. 

The energy consumption data-file we have just loaded is an example of such
a more complex structure built from atomic vectors. We have already encountered a few of
those in our previous lecture.

#### Atomic vectors {#sec-atomic}

An atomic vector is just a simple vector of data. For example remember when we typed the
infant mortality data for eight European countries for 1860 we typed
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
mr_1860 <- c(0.237, 0.139, 0.136, 0.150, 0.260, 0.102, 0.174, 0.124)
```
In this case `mr_1860` is an atomic vector. 

R has a function, which allows you to check whether an object is an atomic vector or not.
This function is called `is.vector()`. It takes the object name as an argument and returns `TRUE`
if the object is an atomic vector and `FALSE` if it is not. 

For example:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
is.vector(mr_1860)
```
does indeed return `TRUE`.

Each atomic vector stores values in a one-dimensional vector, and each atomic vector can
only store one type of data. The length of the atomic vector can be determined by the
function `length()` This function takes an R object, which is an atomic vector, as an
argument and returns the number of elements in this vector. Here is the example of the die
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
length(mr_1860)
```
which is 8 as it should be. An atomic vector could also have only one element, in which case
`lenght()`would return 1.

#### Data types {#sec-datatypes}

Now altogether R has implemented *six basic types of atomic vectors*:

1. double

2. integers

3. characters

4. logical

5. complex

6. raw

We will not encounter complex and raw data-types in this course, so let us skip those and discuss
only the first 4 types, double, integer, character and logical.

If yo u go back to our energy consumption data and look at the first three lines
```{r}
options(width = 120)
head(energy_consumption, n=3)
```

you will see the different variables in the object `energy_consumption`. Note that I had to fudge a bit
with the display because of the unwieldy and long name of the last variable. We are soon going to fix this.

The variables `Entity`  and `Code` are both of type *character*.  A character vector stores 
strings of text, which have to be put between quotation marks `""`. Strings are the 
individual elements of a character vector.

Note that a string can be more than just letters. If you type, for instance the number `1` with
quotation marks, like `"1"` R would interpret the value as a string not as a number. Sometimes
one can get confused in R because both objects and characters appear as text in R code. Object
names are without quotation marks strings always are between quotation marks.

Character is the natural data type for country names - here "Afghanistan" and the international abbreviation "AFG" also called an ISO-country code^[ISO is the short name for International Organization for Standardization. International Organization for Standardization came into existence in the year 1946 in London. This organization was formed after a delegation of 65 members from 25 countries, met to discuss the future of International Standardization. In 1947, ISO was officially formed with 67 technical committees consisting of a group of experts focusing on a specific subject. ISO founders decided to give it an acronym ISO, which was based on the Greek word ‘isos’, which means ‘equal’.] 

The variable `Year` encodes the year of a particular record or observation. 
Its type is `integer`, since years are integer values like 1980 or
2022. If yo want to specify a number explicitly as integer in R you have to type it as, say, `1980L`, the number followed without space by a big `L`.

The variable with the very long name `Primary.energy.consumption.per.capita..kWh.person.` is of type
double. This is the data type in R for encoding numbers that are decimal fractions, like `12.451`

Now why should we care for distinguishing integers from doubles? This has to do with the
way a computer does computations. Sometimes a difference in precision can have surprising effects.

In your computer 64bits of memory^[A bit is a binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer. A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively. So 64 bits are sequences of 0 or 1 with a length of 64] are allocated 
for each double in an R program. While this
allows for a very precise representation of numbers not all numbers can be exactly represented
with 64-bits. The famous candidates are $\pi$, which has an infinite sequence of digits and must
therefore be rounded by the computer. Usually the rounding error introduced into your
computations will go unnoticed but sometimes surprises can occur. 

Take for instance:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
sqrt(2)^2 - 2
```
Why is that? The square root of 2 can not be expresses precisely because, as already
the old Greeks
knew, it is not a rational number.^[Let me invite you to a short digression into the history of science and the history of ideas. The discovery that $\sqrt{2}$ can not be rational was a shock discovery to the ancient Greeks. The Greek mathematician Pythagoras and his followers were fascinated by and devoted to whole numbers. They detected the fundamental role played by ratios of whole numbers for musical harmony. For example dividing a vibrating string in two half raises the pitch by an octave, dividing the string in three raises the pitch by one fifths and so on. This discovery gave them the clue that the physical world as a whole might have an underlying mathematical structure governed by whole-number patterns. It was thus quite a shock when they
found out that one of their foundational discoveries the Pythagorean theorem logically implied that there
were ratios of lengths that were incommensurable, that is, not measurable as integer multiples of the
same unit. The ratio between such lengths is therefore not a ratio of whole numbers. This is why the Greeks called these numbers irrational. Some of you will remember from school that the Pythagorean theorem says that in a right angled triangle with lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$, where the sides with length $a$ and $b$ from a right angle must fulfill the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ or expressed in a picture
![The Pythagorean theorem](pictures/pythagoras.png){#fig-pyth}
The incommensurable lengths disovered by one member of the pythagorean school was the side and the diagonal of the unit square. By the Pythagorean theorem in a square with side length of 1 it must be the case that
$\text{(lenght of diagonal)}^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$. Thus the length of the diagonal must be
$\sqrt{2}$.
![Length of diagonal in a unit square](pictures/unit_square.png){#fig-usq}
Hence if the diagonal and side are in the ratio $m/n$ (where $m$ and $n$ can be assumed to have no common divisor), we have
\begin{equation}
m^2/n^2 = 2
\end{equation}
thus
\begin{equation}
m^2 = 2 n^2
\end{equation}
This equation implies that $m^2$ must be an even number. So $m$ must be even too, say $m = 2 p$. But if
\begin{equation}
m = 2 p
\end{equation}
then we have
\begin{equation}
2 n^2 = m^2 = 4 p^2
\end{equation}
hence
\begin{equation}
n^2 = 2 p^2
\end{equation}
which similarly implies that $n$ is even. But we began the chain of deductions 
by the assumption that $m$ and $n$ have no common divisor. So if both $m$ and $n$ were even
they would have a common divisor, namely 2. We have arrived at a contradiction. This means the length
of the diagonal of the unit square can not be a rational number. Legend has it that th first Pythagorean to make the result public was drowned at sea. But even if the Pythagoreans could not accept that $\sqrt{2}$
was a number, no one could deny that it was the length of the diagonal of the unit square.] 

And you have a small rounding error. Let me explain to those of you who are puzzled by the
meaning of this output. R displays the result of its computation in scientific notation. `4.440892e-16`
means $4.44089 \times 10^{-16}$. 

For those of you who forgot how exponential notation works, let me remind you that we write $10^{-1}$ for $1/10$ and $10^{-2}$ means $1/10^2$ or $1/100$. Thus $10^{-16}$ means
$1/10.000.000.000.000.000$, a very small number but still different from 0. This is the error introduced
by rounding $\sqrt{2}$.
Such errors
are called *floating point errors* in computer science lingo and computing with such numbers is
called *floating-point-arithmetic*.

With integers floating point errors are avoided, but for many applications this is not an
option. Luckily for most cases floating-point arithmetic provides sufficient precision
for most of the applications we encounter in practice.

The last data type in the list, we want to discuss here, are: **Logicals**. 
Logical vectors store `TRUE` and `FALSE`; logical values. They
are extremely useful for doing comparisons and - as we will see shortly - also for
selecting values from a data set.

How logical data types work can best be understood by an example. If you type, for instance:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
0 > 1
```
R tells you that this statement is false, by printing the logical value `FALSE` 
as an output.

Whenever you type `TRUE` of `FALSE` without quotation marks, R will treat the
input as logical data. Note, as an aside, if you typed `"TRUE"`and `"FALSE"` in quotation marks, R 
would
treat this input as a string co characters, a different data type. When communicating
with a computer, you need to be very precise or the machine will not understand what
you want to tell it do.

For instance, the following statement yields:

```{r}

#| code-fold: false
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logic
```


#### Attributes {#sec-attributes}

One important R-fact which you need to know about atomic vectors is that atomic vectors
can have **attributes**. Attributes won't affect the values of an object but can hold
and store object metadata. 

Normally we do not look at these metadata, but many R functions
check for attributes and then do special things with the object depending on these
attributes. Attributes can be checked with the function `attributes()` using an R object as an argument.
This will show you all the attributes that are attached to an R object.

The most common attributes for atomic vectors as well as R objects built from
atomic vectors are **names**, **dimensions** and **classes**.
Each of these attributes has its own helper function that you can use to also assign attributes to
the object. For what we need now we discuss `names` and `dimensions` and discuss `classes`, which is
a more advanced topic later.

Let us look how this works with the `enegrgy_consumption`data and check whether 
they have a names attribute:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
names(energy_consumption)
```

We can now see the variable names. We can use the function `names()`also as a
helper function to assign other names to our variables. This is a tool that could
help us to get rid of the very long and
unwieldy name `"Primary.energy.consumption.per.capita..kWh.person."`. For example:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
names(energy_consumption) <- c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Cons")
```
will overwrite the name attribute by this new vector of names. When you now look for the
names attribute, you will see

```{r}
names(energy_consumption)
```

One very important attribute, we will encounter all the time is **dimension**, with the
helper function `dim()`. For example we can look at our data object `energy_consumption` again
to get:
```{r}
dim(energy_consumption)
```
which returns two numbers, which mean that the object has 10215 rows and 4 columns.

#### Factors

R stores categorical data, such as nationality, sex etc. by using aspeical data type
called **factors**. If
you take for instance, sex, it can have only two values - male or female - and these
values may have their idiosyncratic order, for example that females go always first.

To make a factor in R you have to pass an atomic vector to the `factor()` function.
This function works by recoding the values in the vector as integers and store the
results in an integer vector. R also adds a `level` attribute which contains the set
of labels and their order and a class attribute that says the vector is
a factor. Example:
```{r sex-factor}
#| code-fold: false 
sex <- factor(c("m", "f", "f", "m"))
typeof(sex)
attributes(sex)
```
Factors can be confusing since they look like characters but behave like integers.

Note that R will often try to convert character strings to factors when you load and create data.
I recommend that you do not allow R to make factors unless you explicitly ask for it. This
can usually be controlled by an argument to whatever the data reader function is. For instance
you can give the `read.csv()` function the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

R has an internal **coercion** behavior for data types, which you should know
about if you work with R. With this knowledge you can do many useful things.

If a character string is present in an atomic vector, R will automatically convert every
other component in this vector to a character string. If a vector contains only logicals
and numbers, R will convert the logicals to numbers. In this case every `TRUE` becomes a 1 and
every `FALSE` becomes a 0.

R also uses the coercion rules, when we do math with logicals, like for example
```{r math-with-logicals}
#| code-fold: false
sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
```
What happens here is that R coerces the vector `c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)` to the
vector `c(1, 1, 0, 0)` and sums the components.

### Data frames and R lists {#sec-data_frame}

Going back to our data set on the enegry consumption data, we see that this data set stores
values of different types, characters, integers and doubles. How does R achieve this?

The answer is that this is achieved by a data structure called a **list**. List are
like atomic vectors, because the group data into a one-dimensional set. However, lists do
not group together individual values. List group together R objects, such as atomic
vectors or even other lists.

For example, you can create a list, which contains a numeric vector of length 31 in its
first element, a character vector of length 1 in its second element and a new list of length 2 in its third. This is done by using the `list()`function of R, like this:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
list_example <- list(100:130, "R", list(TRUE, FALSE))
list_example
```
The double bracketed indices tell you which element of the list is being displayed. The
single bracketed indices tell you which sub-element of the list is being displayed. For example
100 is the first sub element of the first element in the list. "R" is the first sub element of the
second list element.

There is lots to say about lists. But this is an advanced topics. We mentioned it here to
introduce one of the most important data structres for our course the R dataframe.

### Data Frames

**Data Frames** are the two dimensional version of a list. They are by far the most
useful storage structure for data analysis. Indeed, our dataset on energy
consumption data we have loaded before is an instance of a data frame. Data frames group vectors
together in a two dimensional table. As a consequence each variable can have a different type, 
i.e. each column of the
data frame can contain a different data type. Within a column, however, we can have only
one data type. The energy consumption data are a typical example of a dataframe.

```{r}
head(energy_consumption, n = 10)
```

Every column in this tabular array of data can be considered as a vector. 


### Selecting data from R objects: A toolbox.

Asking questions about a dataframe and in particular about our energy data requires that 
we are able to adress particular values in the dataframe. We now learn the most 
important techniques to do so.

R has a notation system to address individual values. You write the object name first, followed by a 
pair of had brackets `[]`. Between the brackets goes a `,` separating row and column indices. The
notation is thus like `energy_consumption[,]`.

When it comes to writing the indices you have six different ways to do this, all of them very simple. You can use:

1. Positive integers
2. Negative integers
3. Zero
4. Blank spaces
5. Logical values
6. Names

The simplest are positive integers. When you want to extract the energy consumption in kwh per person 
in one year - the value of the variable Cons - you would adress for instance the 3rd value in the
Cons column, which is in our case the 4th column as

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
energy_consumption[3,4]
```

You can - of course extract more than one value. If you write for instance

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

energy_consumption[1:5,4]
```
you will get the first 5 values of the consumption numbers in the dataframe. The colon
operator `:` used here is a very useful R operator. It creates sequences of whole
numbers. Thus if you create a vector with the name, say `n10` containing the sequence
of the first 10 whole numbers, you would write

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
n10 <- 1:10
```

Now clearly the indexing rules work in the same way as with dataframes, only that now you have 
only 1 dimension. Say you want to extract the first three numbers from `n10` you would write

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
n10[1:3]
```

Note that R’s notation system is not limited to data frames. The same syntax can be used to select values from any R object, provided you supply an index for each dimension of the object. Two things have to be kept in mind. In R indexing begins at 1. In some other programming languages indexing begins at 0. The indexing convention in R is just like in linear algebra. The second thing to note is that if you select two or more columns from a data frame, R will return a new data frame, like in

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

energy_consumption[1:5, 3:4]
```

 R will always return a dataframe. 
 
However, if you select a single column, R will return a vector:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

energy_consumption[1:5, 4]
```

if you prefer to get returned a data frame in this case, you have to add the argument drop = FALSE, like:

```{r}
energy_consumption[1:5, 4, drop = FALSE]
```


**Negative integers** work exactly opposite to positive integers. If you type:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
head(energy_consumption[-1,4], n = 10)
```
R will return the fourth column of the data frame *except* the first row. We just display the
first 10 values using the `head()` function.

If you try to pair a negative and a positive integer in an index, R will return an error.
However, you can use both negative and positive integers if you use them in *different*
indices.

**Zero** is neither positive nor negative, If you use 0 as an index, R will return nothing
from a dimension with index 0. The following syntax for instance creates an empty object
```{r empty-object}
#| code-fold: false
energy_consumption[0,0]
```

**Blank spaces** are used if you want to ask R to select *every* value in a dimension. So for
instance, if you type:
```{r}
#|code-fold: false
sel <- energy_consumption[ , 4]
```
R will select the entire column of energy consumption. You can check that the length of this
vector is
```{r}
#|code-fold: false
length(sel)
```
as expected.

**Logical Values** can also be used for subsetting. If you type for instance
```{r}
#| code-fold: false 
energy_consumption[1, c(F,F,F,T)]
```
R will select the energy consumption value of the first
observation. Note that here we used the R convention that `TRUE`and `T`
as well as `FALSE`and `F` have an equivalent meaning.

Finally, you can ask for the elements, you want by name. On our case, you could select the first
energy_consumption value by the syntax 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
energy_consumption[1, "Cons"]
```

Finally, note that two types of object in R obey an optional second system of notation. You can
extract values from data frames and lists with th `$`syntax. 

It works as follows: For example
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
test <- energy_consumption$Cons
test[1:4]
```
would select the column of energy consumption numbers in our dataframe, save them in an object
names `test`and then subsequently extract the first four values from the object.

### Application: Reproduce our histogram of primary per capita energy consumption around the globe in 2019 by a worked example.

This was a lot of abstract and dry instruction about some data extraction tools. It will
require lost of practice and concrete examples before you get some natural acquaintance with
these techniques which belong to the everday routines of data analysis.

To see the concept in action, let me take you step by step through an example by showing you how 
you can produce a histogram, like we discussed in the first section of this chapter 
starting from the raw data.

We have already read the data from  the csv file and stored it in an object we have called
`energy_consumption`. We would like to plot a histogram of the annual per capita energy consumption
in different countries around the globe for the year 2019.

Let us look again at the first 10 observations:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
head(energy_consumption, n = 10)
```

How would we extract the observations that refer to the year 2019 only? Here is the
first practical use case of logical data types, which will immediately show you 
their power. Let me suggest the following code and then explain step by step what it does.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
dat <- energy_consumption[energy_consumption$Year == 2019, ]
head(dat, n = 10)
```

Let me explain what is going on here: We have used the indexing rules and logical
subsetting. In the first index we have written a logical condition, namely 
`energy_consumption$Year == 2019`. This means that R selects all the rows for which the year variable of
energy_consumption is equal to 2019. The logical sign for identical in R is `==`. So what R does then
is checking for each value of the Year variable whether it is identical to 2019 - in which case the
logical comparison results in `TRUE` or not, in which case the result would be `FALSE`. Then
by logical subsetting all rows for which the comparison vector is `TRUE` will be selected. Note that
we had to tell R that it needs to compare the Year variable. Year is selected in a data frame by
`energy_consumption$Year`. We have then stored all the data in a vector I have called dat and then
looked at the first 10 rows. You see that only the observations where the Year is 2019 have been
kept, as we had intended.

Now we see from the output that the `Entity` variable apparently not only contains individual countries
but also whole regions or continents, like `Africa` in our example. It seems that the regions have
no ISO code but instead an empty character.

Let's try to apply the logical subsetting logic and our knowledge of character types to filter out
Entities which have no value in the `Code`variable. One way to achieve this would be, for
example the code:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

dat_countries <- dat[dat$Code!="", ]
head(dat_countries, n = 10)
```
Now Africa is out. Of course this is no proof that I have now only entities with ISO-codes left but
it is an indication. We can check this. But let me first expalin what is going on here.

I now work with the object `dat`, the object we have created before by filtering for the observations
in which the `Year`variable is equal to 2019. Now we tell R compare the entries in the `Code`variable, i.e.
in `dat$code` with the condition that they are not equal to an empty string. The symbol for `not identical`
in R is `!=`. We know that the variable `Code` is of type character hence all codes are strings within
quotation marks. An empty string is thus written as `" "`.

How could we check - by the way that the `Code` variable does not contain any empty string anymore?
Here is how:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

sum(dat_countries$Code == "")
```

Here I have used two rules we have dicussed before, logical data types and coercion. First we ask
R to check whether any Code variable in `dat_counties`still has any empty string. This will create
a vector of logicals like (showing only  the first five entries)

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

head(dat_countries$Code == "", n = 5)
```

Now I use coercion rules by summing over this vector. The function `sum()` in R is a function for summation. For example, if I have the vector `c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)` and type

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

sum(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))
```
 R will add up the numbers.
 
Now if I have a vector of logicals and apply a numerical function to it, R will by its coercion
rules, force `TRUE` into 1 and `FALSE` into 0. The result that `sum(dat_countries$Code == "")` equals
0 means that the vector for our logical test contained `FALSE` only. So indeed there is no empty 
`Code` variable anymore.

Now we are ready to do a histogram of the per capita primary annual energy consumption by

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
hist(dat_countries$Cons, 
     xlab = "Primary energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per person per year.",
     main = "Primary energy Consuption per Capita 2019")
```

I have here used the `xlab`and `main`arguments with a character value to have a nicer description
of the histogram. Otherwise the x axis would have been labeled `dat_countries$Cons` and the title
would have been `Histogram of dat_countries$Cons`. Note that we have here a histogram in the absolute frequency scale.

Exercise 6:

One investigator takes a sample of 100 men age 18 - 24 in a certain town. Another one takes a sample
of 1000 such men.

(a)   Which investigator will get a bigger average for the heights of the men in his sample? Or should the average be about the same?

(b) Which investigator will get a bigger standard deviation for the heights of the men in his sample? or should the standard deviation be about the same for both investigators?

(c) Which investigator is likely to get the tallest of the sample men? Or are the chances about the same
for both investigators?

(d) Which investigator is likely to get the shortest of the sample men? Or are the chances about the same
for both investigators?

Open the notebook `exercises_summarizing_and_communicating_lots_of_data.ipynb` 
and work on the exercises. Write your solutions into the notebook. You will
need the computer to do this work.



<!-- ## Contents  -->

<!-- Statistics usually involves lots of data and we need ways to communicate and summarize these data. This -->
<!-- chapter introduces the most important concepts. -->


<!-- 1. The empirical distribution of data points -->
<!-- 2. Measures of location and spread. -->
<!-- 3. Skewed data distributions are common and some summary statistics are very sensitive to outlying values.  -->
<!-- 4. Summaries always hide some detail.  -->
<!-- 5. How to summarize sets of numbers graphically (histograms and box plots) -->
<!-- 6. Useful transformations to reveal patterns -->
<!-- 7. Looking at pairs of numbers, scatter plots, time series as line graphs.  -->
<!-- 8. The primary aim in data exploration is to get an idea of the overall variation. -->

<!-- ## Next steps in R: -->

<!-- - vectors and indices -->
<!-- - extracting subsets from vectors -->
<!-- - creating vectors using c() -->
<!-- - subsetting vectors wit logicals -->
<!-- - data frames -->
<!-- - factor class -->
<!-- - extracting data from data frames -->
<!-- - tapply -->



<!-- ## Outcome  -->

<!-- Understand these concepts and work through may examples showing how to apply these summary measures to data on the -->
<!-- computer. -->
