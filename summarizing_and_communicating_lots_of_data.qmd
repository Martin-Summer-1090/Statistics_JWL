# Summarizing and communicating lots of data

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Overview

1. In this chapter we will learn how to summarize and communicate lots of data. Most
   datasets you will be working with in statistics are large and can contain thousands or
   even millions of observations. To understand these data and their pattern of
   variation you need tools to summarize them in a meaningful and informative way. In this
   chapter you will learn the tools to do so.

2. We first discuss a graphical tool to summarize the variation in a single variable by
   organizing the data in a way that shows us a the distribution of these
   data. This tool is called a **histogram** and you will encounter it very often across
   all applied data work and across all of statistics. To get a good understanding how to
   construct and work with a histogram, we first work with an example you can in principle
   do without a computer. This is useful to understand the basic principles of constructing
   and reading a histogram.
   
3. You will also learn to summarize large datasets by single numbers that provide information
   about the central tendency of the values of a variable. The **mean** is such a number, used
   over and over in statistics. You will learn what a mean is, what it tells you and when
   it gives a meaningful summary about the center of the distribution of a variable.

4. For a summary of a large dataset by numbers, you need not only an idea of at which values
   of a variable the data are centered but also how much they are spread out around this value.
   Such a measure of spread is the **standard deviation**. Like the mean understanding and 
   working with standard deviations is fundamental and will be encountered over and over
   again throughout the large field of statistics and applied work with data. You need
   to gain a good understanding of what the standard deviation is and how to compute it.

5. For larger datasets, which will be the usual case in practice, you will need to learn
   how to summarize and communicate the information about variables with lost of different
   values using the computer. This means in particular, that you need to understand how
   to read large datafiles from a given source, how to select and modify particular variables.
   You will thus learn some powerful tools from the R language that will help you to
   do so.

When you have worked through this unit you will be able to summarize large datasets
graphically and numerically and understand what these measures tell you about the
variation in the data, how they look like, what are the most typical values of the variables
and how much they are spread out around these values. In this process you will power up
your abilities to read, select and manipulate large data files and single variables using the
R language. This will enlarge your abilities to work with data by a huge and important step.

:::

When we analyze data, we usually have to look at lots of them. As a leading example,
let us take the case of anthropometric data. These are data measuring height and weight
of humans in a population.^[Anthropometry (This is a word with roots from ancient greek. 
In ancient greek anthropos means 'human', and m√©tron means 'measure'. Anthropometry thus 
refers to the measurement of the human individual. An early tool of physical 
anthropology, it has been used for identification, for the 
purposes of understanding human physical variation]. These data are usually gathered via
large population survey like the Demographic and Health Survey, abbreviated DHS^[The DHS 
program, a US based program on demographics and health in various parts of the 
developing world. The data are used to monitor demographic and health 
developments to decide where policy action might be needed. The DHS website 
can be found here: https://dhsprogram.com/ ] 

What's the point of recording the height and
weight of humans? 
First of all, human growth depends on good nutrition and the 
availability of medical services to 
effectively treat illness. Thus human height in a population has for a long time been
a subject of study. The average human height in a population varies with the general 
living standards. This fact makes data on human height especially interesting
for historians who study the history of living conditions. 
Because humans tend to get taller when
they have good living conditions, human height can reveal some information 
on living conditions, height
data can be an indirect measure of living conditions. This is especially interesting for
periods when very little or no data were collected and recorded.

But also tody information about the distribution of height and weight in a 
population enables countries 
to make data-driven decisions and to monitor their progress in improving 
nutritional status and achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.^[
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection 
of seventeen interlinked objectives designed to serve as a "shared blueprint for peace 
and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future." 
The goals were set and decided by the 
United Nations General Assembly and are monitored through various data collection 
efforts, including the DHS. The short titles of the 17 SDGs are: No poverty (SDG 1), 
Zero hunger (SDG 2), Good health and well-being (SDG 3),
Quality education (SDG 4), Gender equality (SDG 5), 
Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), 
Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), 
Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), 
Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), 
Reduced inequalities (SDG 10), Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), 
Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), 
Climate action (SDG 13), Life below water (SDG 14), Life on land (SDG 15), 
Peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG 16), Partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).
See also the website: https://sdgs.un.org/goals]

The measurement of human height and weight are also important in the history of statistics.
Especially important concepts describing the statistical relation between two variables,
were detected in this context. We will learn about these concepts later, when we study the
statistical tool of regression.

We will use a dataset from the DHS later in this chapter, when we discuss how to
use R to deal with large datasets. The number of observations in this case is 2559. This
is not very big but certainly too big to reasonably handle by hand. With a 
computer this becomes realistic. 

But before we do so, lets look at a smaller example of human height data.

## The histogram

To summarize data, statisticians often use a graph which is called a **histogram**. 
In this section we will discuss all you have to know about histograms and how to use them.

Reda, I think it would be great that among the activities in the study center we collect
some data about the students in the group. I would suggest height, weight. These
varibles can be measured and recorded and the students could be asked to store these
data in a text file, sow e can read them by R here. We could then
use these data here to explain how a histogram is constructed or give it as an exercise.
:::

### Constructing a histogram

Since real world examples in this exposition come from anthropometry, let us 
look at a sample of 100 observations from a set of real world data about human adults
of age 18 and above, where the data record their height in cm.^[These data are collected from
the internet. For details you can look at the source at http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_Dinov_020108_HeightsWeights] I have
stored these values in an R object which I called `heights`. So in this discussion I refer
to the 100 vaues shown below as `heights`.
```{r}
library(JWL)
dat <- socr_height_weight
dat$Height <- dat$Height*2.54

set.seed(1)
heights <- sample(x = dat$Height, size = 100) # randomly select 100 values without replacement.
heights
```
This is how R prints out the 100 height values. You already learned what the numbers in
brackets on the left side mean. They are counters or observations. In total we have
100 values.

We start the construction of a histogram by choosing for the horizontal 
axes ranges of numerical
values - in our case of the height data - which are called *bins* or *classes*. There is no
fixed rule as to how to choose the size of these ranges. These ranges should neither be too 
fine, nor too
coarse. While there are lists of mechanical rules, which you 
can for example find on Wikipedia^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width], it is 
usually best to use your domain
knowledge and some experimentation to find out the bin size that works best for your data.

For this example, assume we had chosen a bin size of 5 cm. When you study 
the list, you will find that the lowest value is at 160.12 cm  while the highest value
is at 185.16. This is already quite tedious to find out by 
eyeballing the numbers with the small 
number of values we have chosen for this example. 
It is impossible to do for really large data sets.

Now lets make a distribution table like this:

| Height-bin | Frequency |
|-----------:|----------:|
| 160 -  165 |          7|
| 165 -  170 |         20|
| 170 -  175 |         39|
| 175 -  180 |         28|
| 180 -  185 |          5|
| 185 -  190 |          1|


In the column Height-bin we have recorded the bins in steps of 5 and in the right 
column, Frequency, we have recorded the count of values that are in this bin. 

When we make such a tabulation we have to agree on an endpoint convention. 
This is important, since 
when a height value would for instance be measured as exactly 165, in which bin 
should it be counted:
160-165 or 165-170? You, the constructor of the histogram, has to take this decision. Let us
agree on the convention that when a value falls exactly at the endpoint of the bin, we
put it in the next bin. In practice you
will usually do a histogram by computer. 
The code of the computer program has to specify an endpoint
convention, so the computer knows what to do when a value coincides with an endpoint.

On the Frequency axes you put the frequency scale: Counts of values. 
Then for each bin, you plot
a bar, which has the width of the bin and the height of the frequency. 
Do this for all the bins
you have tabulated and you are ready.

The histogram provides a certain aggregation of the data because it sorts 
the 100 data points into 6
bins, in our example. While loosing some local information on 
individual data points the global information
conveyed by the summary gives us a pretty good idea of the overall 
pattern of variation on the human height data.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Seitwerk: Expand for reading comment.
Reda, I think it would be great if you could do some animation that reproduces the 
steps: Plot a height axis with bins from 160 to 190 in bin sizes of 5, then plot a frequency
axes from 0 to 40 in steps of 10. Them from the list of 100 numbers, collect all that are
recorded in the first bin and then make the height proportional to the count, then the next
etc. The idea would be to realize something like my previous sketch for the Nile data
![Constructing the river flow histogram](pictures/nile_hist.png)
:::

We can see, for instance, that the most frequent height is between 170 and 175 and that the
variation is fairly symmetric around this bin. In the extremes this most frequent 
value can half or shrink even more, so there is quite some spread in the data.

If we had just plotted all individual data points, we would have got a picture like this.

```{r}
plot(as.numeric(heights), xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Height in cm", pch = 16)
```

You will agree that as a summary of the data it is not particularly useful and not
as informative as the histogram.

Histograms are such a common tool in statistics to explore the variation 
in one variable and the shape, how
it is roughly distributed that every statistical software has functions 
to produce histograms. 

In R, the
language we use in this course, there is also such a function. 
The function name is called `hist()` and it
takes the data as an argument. This is the second graphic function 
of R you encounter in this course
after we played with the `barplot()`function in the last lecture. 

To produce a histogram from the height data with R, we type at the console

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hist(heights)
```

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try

Let us check your understanding of histograms by a little quiz now. The histogram below
shows the distribution of the final score in a certain class.

(a) Which block represents the people who scored between 60 and 80?
(b) Ten percent scored between 20 and 40 about what percentage scored between 40 and 60?
(c) About what percentage scored over 60?

Reda, I think it would be great if you could redo the graphics with
computer. I have these hand drawn graphs only because I did not have
enough time to play around with computer graphics and because I
wanted to experiment how such pictures would look like. I think
a computer graph would be better.
:::

### The relative frequency scale: Absolute versus relative frequency

Sometimes it might be useful, to choose a different scale for the y axes of 
your histogram. Instead
of absolute frequencies (or counts) it might be useful to show relative 
frequencies, the proportion
of occurrences in each bin. The type of scale you choose will depend on what kind of 
comparisons you want to emphasize about your data.

Assume you would want to draw your histogram such that on the y-axis you do not
see the absolute counts of how many individuals in your data fell into a certain
hight bin but you want to see instead these numbers as a percentage of the whole
dataset. 

This is sometimes convenient and in some cases more informative. This choice of
a different scale is called the **relative-frequency-scale**. The construction
of the histogram follows the same principles as we have already discussed but now
we just quantify the counts in the bins differently as shares of all observations.

Let's do the histogram for the heights data in a relative frequency scale. In
our table, which we used to construct the histogram before we had in total
100 observations. A count of 7 is therefore 7 % or 0.07 in the relative frequency
scale etc. Thus our table would now be:

| Height-bin | Frequency |
|-----------:|----------:|
| 160 -  165 |       0.07|
| 165 -  170 |       0.20|
| 170 -  175 |       0.39|
| 175 -  180 |       0.28|
| 180 -  185 |       0.05|
| 185 -  190 |       0.01|

and the histogram in relative frequency scale would look like this:
```{r}
h<-hist(heights, plot=F)
h$counts <- h$counts / sum(h$counts)
plot(h, freq=TRUE, ylab="Relative Frequency")
axis(2, at = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4), labels = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4))
```

Unfortunately R has no standard argument to its `hist()`function to draw a
histogram with a relative frequency scale. To produce a histogram like shown
here we would need some more advanced coding than we know at the moment.^[The `hist()` function in R has an argument, called `freq`. It can take the value `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If the
argument is set to `FALSE` the histogram is shown such that the y axis has yet another
scale, the so called density scale. This scale is chosen such that the total area of
the histogram is 1.] I will come back to explain how to do a histogram with relative
frequency scale in R as soon as we have learned the appropriate syntax to implement this.

### Best practices for histograms

When you summarize lots of data by a histogram there are some things you should 
consider carefully. Let us go through the most important best practice 
principles for histograms.

#### Bin size

When doing exploratory data work it is usually a good idea not to look at a single 
histogram but at several histograms of the same data by changing the bin size. There
is no clear rule about the optimal bin size. It often depends on context and field 
knowledge. 

If the bins are to fine, then the data will be be very noisy and give no overview because
they show too many individual points. On the other hand if the bins are too wide, they
will not show you the overall variability in the data very well and you fail to
get a good idea about the distribution. 

Let us illustrate this point using our heights data. 

In the first case we have chosen 100 bins, which is too fine. There is almost one bar
for every single data point. In this way we have a lot of spurious peaks and throughs and can
not see the variation pattern in the data very clearly

```{r}
hist(heights, breaks = seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 100))
```
Now here we have the other extreme, lets assume we have only 3 bins. This would give us
a pattern like this.

```{r}
hist(heights, breaks = seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 3))
```
Here the histogram is too coarse and we do not see the variation pattern either. 

The computer usually has a built in rule of thumb for the histogram 
which will work well in most
of the cases. Still for individual datasets it is sometimes better 
to choose a different bin size
that more adequately mirrors the variation in the data.

#### Choose boundaries that can be clearly interpreted

Tick marks and labels should fall on the bin boundaries. As in the examples discussed
so far, they need not be there for every tick but it is enough if they are there between
every few bars. Bin labels should also have not many significant digits, so they are easy to
read. So bin sized which divide 10 and 20 evenly are easier to read than bin sizes that do not.
So always take caution not to arbitrarily split bin sizes. Otherwise you can end up with
off bin boundaries.

For example, if we just took the maximum and the minimum of the heights data and
arbitrarily divided them into 7 bins, we would get the difficult to read bin boundaries

```{r}
seq(min(heights), max(heights), length.out = 7)
```

instead of the more easily readable boundaries

```{r}
seq(160,190,5)
```

#### What's the difference between a histogram and a bar chart?

A histogram depicts the frequency distribution of a continuous, quantitative variable, such 
as height, weight, time, energy consumption etc. These are variables that can take on any
value and these values can be ordered from smallest to highest.

When we have a categorical variable, like we encountered them in section 2, 
we need to use a bar chart.
The bars of the bar chart typically will have a small gap between the bars, emphasizing 
the discrete
nature of the variable. The categories in a bar chart usually have no natural ordering. 
As we discussed
in section 2, we have even to be conscious how we display the categories to 
avoid suggesting an
order that is in fact not there in the data.

## The average and the standard deviation

With a histogram we can summarize a large amount of data and get some insights about the
variation in the data. Often we can summarize data much more drastically by just one number
describing the center of the histogram and the spread around this center. When I write center
an spread here, these are just ordinary words with no special technical meaning.

When we do statistics we need 
precise definitions and we will study and learn these definitions in this section. 
The **average** is
often used to find the center. Another measure to find 
the center is the **median**. The **standard** deviation measures spread around 
the average. The **interquartile range** is another measure of 
spreads.

Before we go into these definitions, let me show for a start 
two histograms, both have the same center, but the second one is more spread
out, there are more observations farther away from the center.

```{r}
#| include: false

set.seed(1)
dat1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 2)
dat2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 6)

png("pictures/example_histogram1.png")
hist(dat1, xlab = "", main = "", xlim = c(-20, 20), breaks = 30)
abline(v = mean(dat1),                       # Add line for mean
       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat1) + sd(dat1)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat1) - sd(dat1)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()

png("pictures/example_histogram2.png")
hist(dat2, xlab = "", main = "", xlim = c(-20, 20), breaks = 30)
abline(v = mean(dat2),                       # Add line for mean
       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat2)+ sd(dat2)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(dat2) - sd(dat2)),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()
```

![Histogram 2](pictures/example_histogram2.png){#fig-ex-hist-2}

Histogram 1 and Histogram 2 have the same center but Histogram 2 is more spread out
:::

These distributions can be summarized by the center and the spread. But what about a situation like this?
```{r}
#| include: false 

mu1 <- log(0.03)   
mu2 <- log(50)
sig1 <- log(3)
sig2 <- log(2)
cpct <- 0.4

  y0 <- rlnorm(n,mean=mu1, sd = sig1)
  y1 <- rlnorm(n,mean=mu2, sd = sig2)

  flag <- rbinom(n,size=1,prob=cpct)
  y <- y0*(1 - flag) + y1*flag 
}

bimodalData <- bimodalDistFunc(n=100000,cpct,mu1,mu2, sig1,sig2)

png("pictures/bimodal.png")
hist(log(bimodalData), breaks = 50, xlab = "", main = "")

       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(log(bimodalData))+ sd(log(bimodalData))),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
abline(v = (mean(log(bimodalData)) - sd(log(bimodalData))),
      col = "blue",
      lwd = 2)
dev.off()
```


![A bimodal distribution](pictures/bimodal.png){#fig-ex-hist-bm}

In some cases such distribution can occur naturally. 
Think, for example, about the distribution of the elevation data of surface area of the earth.
Most of the surface area of the earth is taken by the sea floor at about three 
miles below the sea level 
or the continental planes around sea level. If we would report only the center an the spread
of this histogram, plotted in the picture as the red and blue vertical lines, we would miss these peaks.

### The average

Let us come back to the height data, we have analyzed in a histogram before as the
context for which we study the concept of an average.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Average

The average of a list of numbers is defined as their sum, divided by how
many numbers their are in the list.

:::

For example the average of the list $L$

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
L <- c(9,1,2,2,0)
```

would be computed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{(9+1+2+2+0)}{5} = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8
\end{equation}

By now it will be no surprise for you that R provides a function for computing averages.
This function is known by the alternative name for the average, called the mean.

Here is how you would compute the mean using R.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(L)
```

which is indeed what we should get as a result.

Let's go back to the issue of human height data and take our data set of
100 observations of the height of adult humans. Let us recall
our histogram and give it some nice title and a precise label for the
x-axis:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hist(heights, xlab = "Height in cm", main = "Height of 18 year old humans")
```

The distribution looks symmetric. If we summarize these data by taking an average in one number
we will capture the center of the distribution fairly well. 
Let us compute the average, using the
mean function. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
average_height <- mean(heights)
average_height
```

The average height in this dataset is about `r average_height`  cm. 
The average is a very powerful way of
communicating data by compressing many observations into one single
number, the mean. 

This compression is, however, only achieved by loosing some 
information on individual differences.
For example in our dataset the average height is `r average_height` cm. 

But there are about `r mean(heights > 180)*100` % who are larger than
180 cm and there are also about `r mean(heights < 165)*100` % who are 
smaller than 165 cm. With 100 individuals these are
individuals who are beyond these thresholds. This diversity 
is hidden in the aggregation.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title

This is a good opportunity to show you a cool feature or trick in R how we could in one line
compute such percentages. Assume we want to compute the percentage of individuals in our data
who are larger than the mean of `r average_height`. How can we do this?

Logicals are a powerful data type to make such a computation. A logical is
a special data type, similar to the data type numerical, used for representing numbers, or
the data type character, representing strings. A logical can 
either be `TRUE` or `FALSE` and will be the output of an R operation testing a condition.

Say we have 10 numbers, given by

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x <- c(4,5,1,2,4,2,0,10,11,6)
```

Now we could ask R which entries of x are larger than 2 by typing

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x > 2
```

The output is a vector of logicals where R compares 
each entry in `x`with 2 and if it is larger it 
returns `TRUE` and otherwise `FALSE` (this includes all entries which are exactly 2). 

Note that, when you apply the function `mean()` to a vector of data of 
type logical R performs a computation by coercing `TRUE`to the number 1 and `FALSE` to the
number 0. We will learn about the details of these R the coercion rules later in more detail.
If you apply `mean()` to `x` you will get the proportion of values fulfilling a certain
condition. So if you take the mean of
```{r}
x > 2
```
R would firts transfrom the vector

`TRUE`,  `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `FALSE`, `TRUE`,  `FALSE`,  `FALSE`,  `TRUE`,  `TRUE`,  `TRUE`

into a vector

1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1.

When you take the mean
\begin{equation}
\frac{1+1+0+0+1+0+0+1+1+1}{10}
\end{equation}
you just get the proportion of 1, i.e. cases where the condition $x > 2$ is `TRUE`, because
the 0-es do not contribute to the value of the sum, only the 1-s.

This insight can be used to compute the percentage of values that 
fulfill a certain condition in R.
Here the proportions of heights larger and smaller than the mean.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(heights > mean(heights))
mean(heights < mean(heights))
```
Here you see the symmetry of the distribution numerically. About 50 % are larger and also 
smaller than the mean.
:::


### The standard deviation

When summarizing and communicating lots of data, it is useful not only to report 
at which value the center of the distribution is. It is often helpful to also 
think about the way how the values spread around the average. The quantity which
measures this spread is called the standard deviation. It can be interpreted as 
an average deviation. 

Le us go back to our data on human height. There were 100 observations
in our sample. The average height was `r round(mean(heights),2)` cm.

This average tells us that most of the humans measured in the sample had a height of
around 1 m and 73 cm. But there were deviations from this average. Some humans were
taller and others were smaller. We can ask how big these deviations are? In answering 
this question we need the concept of the standard deviation.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Standard deviation

The standard deviation says how far away numbers on a list are from their
average. Most entries on the list will usually be somewhat around one
standard deviation from the average. Very few will be more than two or three
standard deviations away.

:::

In R you can compute the standard deviation by using the function `sd()`. So let us
compute the standard deviation of our height data using the `sd()`function.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

sd(heights)
```

The standard deviation is at about `r round(sd(heights),2)` cm. That means 
that many humans differed from the
average height by about 1, 2, 3, 4 or about 5 cm. Let us use R to compute the percent
of observation that are within one standard deviation from the average.

Let us compute the percentage of observations, which are within 1 standard deviation
from the mean height. Do you remember the trick with using logicals?

Let us compute the percentage of observations which are larger than the average height minus
und standard deviation and smaller than the average height plus one standard deviation. The
R symbol for and is `&`. Let us use it to formulate the condition:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mean(heights >= mean(heights) - sd(heights) & 
     heights <= mean(heights) + sd(heights))
```

In our case these are 71 % of all observations.

Sometimes it is convenient to subtract the mean from every observation and 
and express the units in terms of standard deviations. By construction this
is a variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This is called standardization
or normalization. Let me show you how this works.

We transform our heights data to 
\begin{equation*}
z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation*}
and compute the mean of $z_i$ and its standard deviation. We can use R to do that:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
z <- (heights - mean(heights))/sd(heights)

mean(z)
sd(z)
```
Now you see that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. 
The mean in the R computation is not exactly 0. R says it is `2.699057e-15`. What does this
mean? This is a way of writing 0.000000000000002699057 in a special notation. Do not worry for
now how this notation works exactly. What you can see is that this is an very very small 
number, practically the same as 0. In R it is not exactly zero because of rounding
errors of the computer. For practical purposed the value is as good as zero. 
This must be the case as a 
consequence of how we changed the units. The mathematically inclined among you might
try to derive this fact more generally using the definition of the mean and the standard
deviation.

Now if we ask the same question as before. Which proportions of $z$ are within
-1 and + 1 standard deviation from the mean, we get

```{r}
mean(z >= mean(z) - sd(z) & 
     z <= mean(z) + sd(z))
```

This is exactly the same value as we got before. Our transformation was just about
changing the units in which our data are measured. This change of unit does not change
the distribution. So no matter whether we work with $x$ the original heights in cm or
with the $z$ the normalized data, the distributional properties do not change. In 
statistics if data are normalized in this way the normalized values are also often
referred to as the **z-score**.

### Computing the standard deviation

Usually we will compute the standard deviation using the 
computer and only in rare cases will we
ever compute a standard deviation by hand. Still it is important that you understand how the
computation works and what is actually been computed. Here is how.

Example 1: Find the standard deviation of the list 20, 10, 15, 15

Step 1: We first need to find the average, which is
\begin{equation}
\frac{20 + 10 + 15 + 15}{4} = 15
\end{equation}

Step 2: We next need to find the deviation from the average. In order to do so, we just subtract
the average from each entry
\begin{eqnarray}
(20-15)&=5\\
(10-15)&=&-5\\
(15-15)&=&0\\
(15-15)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}

Step 3: Now we have to square each one of these differences and take the square root, which is 
often called the root mean square

\begin{eqnarray}
sd&=&\sqrt{\frac{5^2 + (-5)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}{4}} \\
 &=& \sqrt{\frac{25 + 25 + 0 + 0}{4}} \\
 &=& \sqrt{\frac{50}{4}}\\
 &=& \sqrt{12.4}\\
 &\approx& 3.5
\end{eqnarray}

The standard deviation has the same units as the data. 
For example, when we measure height in cm then at the squaring step the units change to $cm^2$ but the squre root returns $cm$ again.

## Now you try

1. Guess which of the following two lists has the larger standard deviation. Check your
guess by computing the standard deviation for both lists.

(i) 9,9,10,10,12
(i) 7,8,10,11,11,13

2. Can the standard deviation ever be negative?

3. For a list of positive numbers can the standard deviation ever be larger than the
average?

## Using the computer to summarize data: Next steps in R {#sec-moreR}

Anthropometric data can help a country to get a data driven picture on the nutritional status
of its population. These data can help identify areas where policy action is needed.
Real world data sets, which will usually come from surveys, will be too large to be
handled manually. For these datasets you need to be able to work with the computer.

We will now learn these skills using data from the DHS survey. The data are used 
to monitor demographic and health developments to decide where policy action 
might be needed.

The data we are using are not from an actual survey but they are from a 
synthetic model dataset provided by the DHS for teaching and training. 
But they reflect realistic values and could come form an actual country
survey.^[The DHS website can be found here: https://dhsprogram.com/ and the 
raw model data sets can be found here https://dhsprogram.com/data/model-datasets.cfm]

Before we go into the details of the data we need a bit of context to understand 
what the data we are looking at here are precisely describing. In the 
analysis we are going to produce a statistical table on the nutritional 
status of children under five years.

The anthropometric data reveal information about a 
persons nutritional status. The nutritional status of children is observed to 
monitor and measure malnutrition. The nutritional 
data of children are included in the United Nations development goals indicators.

The DHS survey collects data on children's sex, age, height-length, and weight to 
monitor the nutritional status of children. The nutritional 
indicators are sex and age specific because boys and girls grow at different rates. 
Their growth rates are also age dependent.

Four indicators on nutritional status are collected in DHS surveys:

(a) **Overweight**: This indicates high weight for height and is a measure of excess weight. 
This results from an imbalance of energy consumed (too much) and energy 
expended (too little). Children with this condition have an increased risk of 
non-communicable diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes and is 
associated with increased risk of being obese and overweight in adulthood.

(b) **Stunting**: This is low height-for-age. It is a measure of growth 
faltering and may result from a deficient growth environment, recurrent 
infections, chronic diseases and other causes. It is associated with 
impaired brain development and reduced academic achievement in childhood 
and lower economic potential as an adult.

(c) **Wasting**: Is low weight-for-height and is a measure of acute weight loss. 
This may result from inadequate food intake or from illness or infection. With 
this condition children are more susceptible for disease and have a 
higher risk of death.

(d) **Underweight**: Is low weight-for-age and is a measure of weight 
relative to a child's age. It reflects children who are stunted 
or wasted or both.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) child growth standards provide a single 
international standard that describes the physiological growth for all children 
from birth to age 5. The measurements of individual children are compared 
to the WHO Child Growth Standards to assess each child's growth. The WHO 
Growth Standards for children use a distribution that is expressed in units of 
standard deviations from the mean, also called z-scores. It is a distribution 
with a mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Within 1 standard deviation are 
about 67 % of all values, within 2 standard deviations it is 95 % and 
within 3 standard deviations 99.7%. 
Height for age, weight for height, and weight for age of children are expressed 
in these units.

Statistical cutoffs are used to measure malnutrition. If a child's height 
for age is below minus two standard deviations from the 
mean (expressed in z-scores), the child is considered stunted. If it is 
below minus three standard deviations from the mean it is considered severely 
stunted. If the weight-for-height z-score is below minus 2 standard 
deviations from the mean the child is considered wasted, if it is below 
three standard deviations from the mean it is considered severely wasted. 
If the weight for height z-score is above two standard deviations from 
the mean the child is considered overweight, if three standard deviations 
above it is considered obese. If the weight for height z-score of a child 
is below two standard deviations from the mean it is considered underweight, if 
three, severely underweight.

The WHO uses the following prevalence thresholds to assess the problems of 
stunting and wasting in a population of children:



|Classification|stunting         |wasting and overweight |
|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------------|
|very high     | 30% or more	   | 15 % or more          |
|high	         | 20 - 29 %	     | 10 - 14 %             |
|medium	       | 10 - 19 %	     |  5 - 9 %              |
|low	         |  2.5 - 9 %	     |  2.5 - 4 %            |
|very low	     | Less than 2.5 % | Less than 2.5 %       |

: WHO Prevalence thresholds for height and weight {.striped .hover}

Prevalence is the proportion of a population who have a specific characteristic 
in a given time period. In a survey prevalence is measured by the number of 
people in a sample who have the characteristic divided by all people in the sample.

Let us go now into the actual data and learn how to use the computer and R
as a tool.

### Reading data in R {#sec-readingdata}

Before we can do anything with data, we need first to learn how  to load data into R and how
to save them. 
We will discuss now how to do this for the case of *comma separated text files* or 
so called *csv* files. Data are very often provided in csv-format. It is one
of the most common data formats for publicly available data.

R provides functions 
for reading and writing from almost any other format, like data stored in
raw text files, in Excel files and many more data formats that are used today.
Since in all those different formats are read by R following the same principles 
as in the csv case, it is sufficient if we discuss here the the case of csv files only.

To read a csv file, R provides the function `read.csv()`. If the csv file
comes with a European instead of an US decimal format (`,` instead of `.` for the
decimal sign.) you need to use the function `read.csv2()`. Please check out the documentation
of these functions by typing `?read.csv` at the R prompt.

In the simplest form you read the data and store them in an object
you can work with in R. How to store data in an R object, we have already learned
in the previous lecture. You invent a name and assign the values to this name using the 
assignment operator `<-`.

Let's call the
object in which we save our data `dhs_data`, then by calling the function `read.csv()` with the
path to your file as an argument will read the data from your 
local folder and store them in the
object we have created. The csv-data-file, we will need for our analysis is called
`children_nutrition_data.csv`^[I have prepared this file from the 
raw DHS data file. This needed many steps, some of them advanced and would be to complex to
discuss in detail at this step.] This allows us to refer to the 
data for doing further computations.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
dhs_data <- read.csv("data/DHS/children_nutrition_data.csv")
```
The function needs as an argument the file name. If the file is in a sub-folder
of  the current directory you need to also specify the path. The path is described
to R as a string of characters. Therefore it needs to be put between "" symbols.

To specify the correct path to the file
you need to know in which part of your directory tree you are currently working.

In my
case I am working in the project folder for my lecture notes, which has a sub-folder called
`data`. The data sub-folder has a further sub-folder called `DHS` in my case
and thus I specify the path relative to this location. 

To find out what is your current
R working directory, R provides the function `getwd()`. If I type this in my case, I will get
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
getwd()
```
the path of my project folder for this lecture notes. So if I type the string
`"data/DHS/children_nutrition_data.csv"` this specifies the path relative to my working directory.

If you read the file on your computer, you need to specify the path appropriately from where
you are working in R at the moment to where you have stored the csv file.

Now `read.csv()` has many additional arguments, which provide you with lots of
flexibility. I encourage you to check it out and play with it using the help function and
the examples given therein by typing `?read.csv` at the prompt.

We have now read the main data file and written it to the 
R-object `dhs_data`. 

Before we are able to see what is inside of this
object and how we can access the data, let us
first explain a few very basic R building blocks or data types.

### R fundamental building blocks

#### R objects {#sec-robjects}

The most basic type of R objects are **atomic vectors**. Objects in R are built
from atomic vectors. 

The dhs data-file we have just loaded is an example of such
a more complex structure built from atomic vectors. We have already encountered a few of
those in our previous lecture.

#### Atomic vectors {#sec-atomic}

An atomic vector is just a simple vector of data. For example remember when we typed the
infant mortality data for eight European countries for 1860 we typed
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
mr_1860 <- c(0.237, 0.139, 0.136, 0.150, 0.260, 0.102, 0.174, 0.124)
```
In this case `mr_1860` is an atomic vector. 

R has a function, which allows you to check whether an object is an atomic vector or not.
This function is called `is.vector()`. 
It takes the object name as an argument and returns `TRUE`
if the object is an atomic vector and `FALSE` if it is not. 

For example:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
is.vector(mr_1860)
```
does indeed return `TRUE`.

Each atomic vector stores values in a one-dimensional vector, and each atomic vector can
only store one type of data. The length of the atomic vector can be determined by the
function `length()` This function takes an R object, which is an atomic vector, as an
argument and returns the number of elements in this vector. Here is the example of the die
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
length(mr_1860)
```
which is 8 as it should be. An atomic vector could also have only one element, in which case
`lenght()`would return 1.

#### Data types {#sec-datatypes}

Now altogether R has implemented *six basic types of atomic vectors*:

1. double

2. integers

3. characters

4. logical

5. complex

6. raw

We will not encounter complex and raw data-types in this course, so let 
us skip those and discuss
only the first 4 types, **double**, **integer**, **character** and **logical**.

Double and integers are the data types which represent numbers. Numbers can be
added, multiplied etc. and functions that use these arithmetic operations to them
can be applied to objects with the data type double or integer.

For example the `mr_1860` - vector is a vector of data type `double`.If the 
numbers are integers only, then the data type is integer.

Now why should we care for distinguishing integers from doubles? This has to do with the
way a computer does computations. In some cases working with integers can support higher
precision. For our purpose the precise distinction will not matter a lot, so let us
not discuss this further at that stage.

**Characters** is a data-type which allows us to represent strings and groups of
strings. Strings are the individual elements of a character vector. Characters always
are between `" "` symbols, or we can also write `' '` which has the same meaning in R.
We have encountered character vectors already in this lecture, for instance when
specifiying the path to the data file when using `read.csv()`.

Note that a string can be more than just letters. If you type, for instance the number 
1 with quotation marks, like "1" R would interpret the value as a string not 
as a number. Sometimes one can get confused in R because both objects and 
characters appear as text in R code. Object names are without quotation 
marks strings always are between quotation marks.

The last data type in the list, we want to discuss here, are: **Logicals**. 
We have already encountered this data type when 
we computed the proportion of values in a vector which fulfills a
certain condition.

Logical vectors store `TRUE` and `FALSE`; logical values. They
are extremely useful for doing comparisons and - as we will see shortly - also for
selecting values from a data set.

How logical data types work can best be understood by an example. If you type, for instance:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
0 > 1
```
R tells you that this statement is false, by printing the logical value `FALSE` 
as an output.

Whenever you type `TRUE` of `FALSE` without quotation marks, R will treat the
input as logical data. Note, as an aside, if you typed `"TRUE"`and `"FALSE"` in quotation marks, R 
would
treat this input as a string co characters, a different data type. When communicating
with a computer, you need to be very precise or the machine will not understand what
you want to tell it do.

For instance, the following statement yields:

```{r}

#| code-fold: false
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logic
```


#### Attributes {#sec-attributes}

One important R-fact which you need to know about atomic vectors is that atomic vectors
can have **attributes**. Attributes won't affect the values of an object but can hold
and store object metadata. 

Normally we do not look at these metadata, but many R functions
check for attributes and then do special things with the object depending on these
attributes. Attributes can be checked with the function `attributes()` using an R object as an argument.
This will show you all the attributes that are attached to an R object.

The most common attributes for atomic vectors as well as R objects built from
atomic vectors are **names**, **dimensions** and **classes**.
Each of these attributes has its own helper function that you can use to also assign attributes to
the object. For what we need now we discuss `names` and `dimensions` and discuss `classes`, which is a more advanced topic, later.

For example, assume we want to know the dimensions of our data object `dhs_data`. We
could use the helper function `dim` which would read the dimension attribute of 
`dhs_data` and print the dimensions. Let's do this
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

dim(dhs_data)
```

The first number gives us the number of rows and the second the number of columns. We have
`r dim(dhs_data)[1]` rows or individual observations and `r dim(dhs_data)[2]` columns. You
see this is a large dataset and has many variables. 

The variables are named and we can retrieve these names using the `names()`function. Let
us do this for our data. 
```{r}
#| code-fild: false

names(dhs_data)
```
The variable names are sometimes self explaining and sometimes not at all. Usually their
meaning has to be learned from the metadata or the data documentation file.

#### Factors

R stores categorical data, such as nationality, sex etc. by using a speical data type
called **factors**. If
you take for instance, sex, it can have only two values - male or female - and these
values may have their idiosyncratic order, for example that females go always first.
This variable is called for example `HV104` in the DHS data, as can be seen from the
code manual.

To make a factor in R you have to pass an atomic vector to the `factor()` function.
This function works by recoding the values in the vector as integers and store the
results in an integer vector. R also adds a `level` attribute which contains the set
of labels and their order and a class attribute that says the vector is
a factor. Example:
```{r sex-factor}
#| code-fold: false
sex <- factor(c("m", "f", "f", "m"))
typeof(sex)
attributes(sex)
```
Factors can be confusing since they look like characters but behave like integers.

Note that R will often try to convert 
character strings to factors when you load and create data.
I recommend that you do not allow R to make factors unless you explicitly ask for it. This
can usually be controlled by an argument to whatever the data reader function is. For instance
you can give the `read.csv()` function the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

#### Coercion rules

R has an internal **coercion** behavior for data types, which you should know
about if you work with R. With this knowledge you can do many useful things.

If a character string is present in an atomic vector, R will automatically convert every
other component in this vector to a character string. If a vector contains only logicals
and numbers, R will convert the logicals to numbers. In this case every `TRUE` becomes a 1 and
every `FALSE` becomes a 0.

R also uses the coercion rules, when we do math with logicals, like for example
```{r math-with-logicals}
#| code-fold: false
sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))
```
What happens here is that R coerces the vector `c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)` to the
vector `c(1, 1, 0, 0)` and sums the components.
We used these rules before when we discussed the trick of counting the
number of values fulfilling a certain condition.

#### Data frames and R lists {#sec-data_frame}

Our `dhs_data`objects contains variables of all data types we have now
discussed. We also saw that atomic vectors can only contain the same
data type not a mixture of both. How does R achieve holding these different
data types in one object?

The answer is that this is achieved by a data structure called a **list**. List are
like atomic vectors, because the group data into a one-dimensional set. However, lists do
not group together individual values. List group together R objects, such as atomic
vectors or even other lists.

For example, you can create a list, which contains a numeric vector of length 31 in its
first element, a character vector of length 1 in its second element and a new list of length 2 in its third. This is done by using the `list()`function of R, like this:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
list_example <- list(100:130, "R", list(TRUE, FALSE))
list_example
```
The double bracketed indices tell you which element of the list is being displayed. The
single bracketed indices tell you which sub-element of the list is being displayed. For example
100 is the first sub element of the first element in the list. "R" is the first sub element of the
second list element.

There is lots to say about lists. But this is an advanced topics. We mentioned it here to
introduce one of the most important data structres for our course the R dataframe.

#### Data Frames

**Data Frames** are the two dimensional version of a list. They are by far the most
useful storage structure for data analysis. Indeed, our `dhs_data`
dataset  is an instance of a data frame. Data frames group vectors
together in a two dimensional table. As a consequence each variable 
can have a different type, i.e. each column of the
data frame can contain a different data type. Within a column, however, we can have only
one data type. Every column in this tabular array of data can be considered as a vector.

Now after this dense discussion of some fundamental R-concepts, let us 
apply our new knowledge to get a hand on the dhs_data.

### Selecting data from R objects: A toolbox.

Asking questions about a dataframe and in particular about our dhs data requires that
we are able to address particular values in the dataframe. We now learn the most
important techniques to do so.

R has a notation system to address individual values. 
You write the object name first, followed by a
pair of had brackets `[]`. Between the brackets goes a `,` separating 
row and column indices. The
notation is thus like `dhs_data[,]`.

When it comes to writing the indices you have six different ways to do this, all of them very simple. You can use:

1. Positive integers
2. Negative integers
3. Zero
4. Blank spaces
5. Logical values
6. Names

The simplest are positive integers. When you want to extract for instance the value of
the variable `type_of_residence` for the 5th row, which correspond to the 7th record
in your dataset you would implement this with integers as follows:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
dhs_data[7,5]
```

You can - of course extract more than one value. If you write for instance

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

dhs_data[1:5,4]
```
you will get the first 5 values of the consumption numbers in the dataframe. The colon
operator `:` used here is a very useful R operator. It creates sequences of whole
numbers. Thus if you create a vector with the name, say `n10` containing the sequence
of the first 10 whole numbers, you would write

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
n10 <- 1:10
```

Now clearly the indexing rules work in the same way as with dataframes, only that now you have
only 1 dimension. Say you want to extract the first three numbers from `n10` you would write

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
n10[1:3]
```

Note that R‚Äôs notation system is not limited to data frames. The same syntax can be used to select values from any R object, provided you supply an index for each dimension of the object. Two things have to be kept in mind. In R indexing begins at 1. In some other programming languages indexing begins at 0. The indexing convention in R is just like in linear algebra. The second thing to note is that if you select two or more columns from a data frame, R will return a new data frame, like in

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

dhs_data[1:5, 3:4]
```

 R will always return a dataframe.

However, if you select a single column, R will return a vector:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

dhs_data[1:5, 4]
```

if you prefer to get returned a data frame in this case, you have to add the argument drop = FALSE, like:

```{r}
dhs_data[1:5, 4, drop = FALSE]
```


**Negative integers** work exactly opposite to positive integers. If you type:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
head(dhs_data[-1,4], n = 5)
```
R will return the fourth column of the data frame *except* the first row. We just display the
first 10 values using the `head()` function.

If you try to pair a negative and a positive integer in an index, R will return an error.
However, you can use both negative and positive integers if you use them in *different*
indices.

**Zero** is neither positive nor negative, If you use 0 as an index, R will return nothing
from a dimension with index 0. The following syntax for instance creates an empty object
```{r empty-object}
#| code-fold: false
dhs_data[0,0]
```

**Blank spaces** are used if you want to ask R to select *every* value in a dimension. So for
instance, if you type:
```{r}
#|code-fold: false
sel <- dhs_data[ , 6]
```
R will select the entire column of records of children who are severely stunted. 
You can check that the length of this
vector is
```{r}
#|code-fold: false
length(sel)
```
as expected.

**Logical Values** can also be used for subsetting. If you type for instance
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
dhs_data[1, c(F,F,F,T)]
```
R will select the value of the first
observation of the fourth variable. Note that here we used the R 
convention that `TRUE`and `T`
as well as `FALSE`and `F` have an equivalent meaning.

Finally, you can ask for the elements, you want by name. On our case, you could select the first
energy_consumption value by the syntax

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
dhs_data[1, "Wealth Index"]
```

Finally, note that two types of object in R obey an optional second system of notation. You can
extract values from data frames and lists with th `$`syntax.

It works as follows: For example
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
test <- dhs_data$nt_ch_stunt
test[1:4]
```
would select the column of the variable that measures whether a kid is stunted or
not. in our dataframe, save them in an object
names `test`and then subsequently extract the first four values from the object.

### Application: Tabulate malnutrition in children

Let us start by trying to get a rough idea how the data look like. We could do this
by showing just a few records at the beginning, using the `head()`function of R
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

head(dhs_data, n = 5)
```
This shows the first five records including the variable names.

2. Three people plot histograms for the weights of subjects in a study, using the relative
frequency scale. Only one is right. Which one and why?

```{r}

#| echo = false

library(JWL)

dat <- height_weight

data <- dat[dat$state == 1 & dat$sex == 1 & dat$age > 18, ]

hist_inf <- hist(data$height, plot = FALSE)         # Store output of hist function
hist_inf$density <- hist_inf$counts /    # Compute density values
  sum(hist_inf$counts) * 100

png(file="pictures/hight_version1.png")
plot(hist_inf, freq = FALSE, xlab = " ", ylab = " ", main = " ")


png(file="pictures/hight_version2.png")
plot(hist_inf, freq = FALSE, xlab = "hight (cm) ", ylab = "Percent per 5 cm ", main = " ")


png(file="pictures/hight_version3.png")
plot(hist_inf, freq = FALSE, xlab = "hight (cm) ", ylab = "5 cm per percent", main = " ")

```

3. An investigator draws a histogram for some height data, using the metric system. She is working in
centimeters (cm). She wants to draw the histogram in a so called density scale, i.e. in a scale that the area of all the bars sum to 1. The vertical axes shows relative frequency
and the top of the vertical axes is 10 percent per cm. Now she wants to convert to millimeter (mm). There are 10 millimeter to the centimeter. On the 
horizontal axis, she has to change 175 cm to ? mm, 200 cam to ? mm. On the vertical axis she has to change 10 percent per cm to ? percent per mm, and 5 percent per cm to ? percent per mm.

4. In a Public Health Service study, a histogram was plotted showing the number of 
cigarettes per day smoked by each subject (male current smokers), as shown in the 
histogram below. The density is marked in
parentheses. The class interval include the right endpoint, not the left.

   (a) The percentage who smoked 10 cigarettes or less per day is around:

        1.5%    15%   30%   50%

   (b) The percentage who smoked more than a pack a day, but not more than 2 packs, is around

        1.5%    15 %    30%   50%
        (There are 20 cigarettes in a pack)

   (c) The percentage who smoked more than a pack a day is around

        1.5%,   15%,   30%,   50%

   (d) The percent who smoked more than 3 packs a day is around

        0.25 of 1%,    0.5 of 1%,     10 %

   (e) The percent who smoked 15 cigarettes per day is around

        0.35 of 1%,    0.5 of 1%,   1.5%,    3.5%,    10%

### The Average

Exercise 1:

(a) The number 3 and 5 are marked by crosses on  the horizontal line below. Find the average of 
    these two numbers and mark it by an arrow.
    
    ![](pictures/average_a.png)
    
(b) Repeat (a) for the list 3,5,5

    ![](pictures/average_b.png)
    
(c) Two numbers are shown below by crosses on a horizontal axis. Draw an arrow
    pointing to their average.
    
    ![](pictures/average_c.png)
    
Exercise 2: 

A list has 10 entries. Each entry is either 1, 2 or 3. What must the list be of the average is
1? if the average is 3? Can the average be 4?

Exercise 3:

Which of the following lists has a bigger average? Or are they the same? try 
to answer without doing arithmetic.

(i) 10, 7, 8, 3, 5, 9   (ii) 10, 7, 8, 3, 5, 9, 11

Exercise 4:

Ten people in a room have an average height of 1.69 m. An 11th person is 1.96 enters
the room. Find the average height of all 11 people.

Exercise 5:

Twenty-one people in a room have an average height of 1.68. A 22nd person who is 1.96
enters the room. Find the average height of all 22 people. Compare with exercise 4.

Exercise 6:

Twenty-one people in a room have a height of 1.68. A 22nd person enters the room. 
How tall would he have to be to raise the average height by 1 inch.

Exercise 7:

If you go back to figure @fig-ex-hist-bm, where in the Histogram would be mountains?
Where would you find planes? Where would the trenches in the sea floor show?

Exercise 8: 

Diastolic blood pressure is considered a better indicator of heart trouble than systolic
pressure. The figure below shows age-specific average diastolic blood pressure for
men age 20 and over in a health survey from the US (HANES5 (2003-04)). True or fales: The
data show that as men age, their diastolic blood pressure increases until age 45
or so. and then decreases. If false, how do you explain the pattern in  the graph?
(Blood pressure is measured in "mm" that is millimeter of mercury)

Exercise 9:

Average hourly earnings in the US are computed each month by the Bureau fo Labor statistics using 
payroll data from commercial establishments. The Bureau figures the total 
wages paid out to non-supervisory personnel, and divides
by the total hours worked. During recessions, average hourly earnings typically go up. 
When the recession ends, average hourly earnings often start going down. How can this be?

### The standard deviation

Exercise 1:

The `socr_height_weight` about the height and weight of 18 year old humans, we had used in the
lecture before the average height in inches was about 173 cm and the standard deviation was about
5 cm.

(i) One individual was 188 cm. He was above average by how many standard deviations?
(ii) Another individual was 174.66 cm. She was above average by how many standard deviations?
(iii) A third individual was 1.5 standard deviations below the average height. He was how many cm?
(iv) If an individual was within 2.25 standard deviations of average height, the shortest height for this
individual would be how many cm? The highest height would be how many cm?

Exercise 2:

(a) Here are the heights of 4 individuals. 150 cm, 130 cm, 180 cm, 172 cm. Match 
the heights with the description. A description may be used twice.

unusually short, about average, unusually tall

(b) About what percentage of individuals in the data had heights between 170.2 and 173.2 ? Between
    165.5 and 179.2?
    
Exercise 3: 

Each of the following lists has an average of 50. For which one is the spread of
the numbers around the average biggest? Smallest?

(i)     0, 20, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100
(ii)    0, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 100
(iii)   0,1,2,50,98, 99, 100

Exercise 4:

Each of the following lists has an average of 50. For each one, guess whether the standard deviation is around 1, 2, or 10. (This does not require any arithmetic.)

(a)   49, 51, 49, 51, 49, 51, 49, 51, 49, 51
(b)   48, 52, 48, 52, 48, 52, 48, 52, 48, 52
(c)   48, 51, 49, 52, 47, 52, 46, 51, 53, 51
(d)   54, 49, 46, 49, 51, 53, 50, 50, 49, 49
(e)   60, 36, 31, 50, 48, 50, 54, 56, 62, 53

Exercise 5:

Below are three sketches of three stylized histograms 
(we call them "sketches" because they display a schematic
shape of a hypothetical histogram. This is why these sketches do not look like real histograms.) 
Match the sketch with the description. Some descriptions will be left over. 
Give your reasoning in each case. The
symbol $\approx$ is the mathematical notation for *approximately*.

(i)   ave $\approx$ 3.5, sd $\approx$ 1       (iv) ave $\approx$ 2.5, sd $\approx$ 1
(ii)  ave $\approx$ 3.5, sd $\approx$ 0.5     (v)  ave $\approx$ 2.5, sd $\approx$ 0.5
(iii) ave $\approx$ 3.4, sd $\approx$ 2       (vi) ave $\approx$ 4.5, sd $\approx$ 0.5

Exercise 6:

One investigator takes a sample of 100 men age 18 - 24 in a certain town. Another one takes a sample
of 1000 such men.

(a)   Which investigator will get a bigger average for the heights of the men in his sample? Or should the average be about the same?

(b) Which investigator will get a bigger standard deviation for the heights of the men in his sample? or should the standard deviation be about the same for both investigators?

(c) Which investigator is likely to get the tallest of the sample men? Or are the chances about the same
for both investigators?

(d) Which investigator is likely to get the shortest of the sample men? Or are the chances about the same
for both investigators?
