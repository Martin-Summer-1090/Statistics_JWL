# Solution manual for Statistics: The art and science of learning from data.

This is a manual with worked solutions for all the exercises and
project steps in the course "Statistics: The art and science of learning
from data". The manual is for the use of on-site learning facilitators to
support students in their efforts to work on exercises and assignments.

Note that there are usually several ways to solve a problem, in particular
how to implement certain tasks in R. So the solutions worked out here
should be seen as a suggested solution.

I have taken great efforts to assure that all exercises and problems can 
be solved and when numerical answers are asked for that they are correct.
Should you despite of all this detect a mistake, please report the
issue to martin.summer@chello.at
