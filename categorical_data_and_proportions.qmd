# Categorical Data and Proportions

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Overview

1. In this chapter we will learn how to analyze and communicate binary variables. Binary
variables express answers to yes-no questions. When we summarize many such answers we
can express them as proportions or percentages.

2. We will discuss these concepts within the examples of infant-mortality. This topic is
not only interesting because it provides you a very important real world case where we
work with counts and proportions of binary variables. It is also a great story of
progress and positive global developments, where the data show you how much we have achieved
together to better the life of children and infants.

3. You will learn about important aspects when you communicate such data such as framing, choosing 
appropriate and truthful visualizations and translate numbers in a way that promotes understanding.

4. You will also make your first steps in R, a computer language that we will use throughout the course
and where you are going to build your skills step by step. Here you will already do your first
visualization applying all the principles taught in this section.

5. When a variable can take on not only two but more values we speak of categorical variables and we
discuss and generalize the principles we learn about the display and communication of binary data to
the case of categorical data.

6. You will learn about the important notions of relative and absolute risks and what an odds ratio is. By the end of this section you will have learned some important principles of data visualization and 
communication that will be relevant and important also in other lessons.

The death of a child is a tragedy to its family. The numbers of such
events across the globe add up to millions. Max Roser, in an article
on the website "Our world in Data" [@Ros], reports that from 
56 million people who died for example in the year
2017, 5.4 millions were children under the age of 5. This is a number of 
enormous scale that never makes the
headlines.

In his article Roser [@Ros] puts this scale into perspective. He writes:

"...*The suffering and dying of children remains immense, yet these daily tragedies continue without receiving the attention this injustice deserves. A comparison of the tragedy of child deaths with those tragedies that do receive public attention puts it in perspective. A large jumbo jet can carry up to 620 passengers. The number of child deaths is that of 24 jumbo jet crashes, with only children on board, every single day. Single events – such as plane crashes – always make the headlines. Daily tragedies – even the worst ones like the deaths of thousands of children – never make the headlines.*

In pre-industrial societies infant- and child-mortality were uniformly and cruelly high. They
were a universal and frequent experience for families all over the world. 

Such tragic events are today counted as well as reported and compiled in so called mortality statistics,
usually by national health authorities and civil registration and statistics systems. These
data are then again collected and globally reported by the United Nation World Health 
Organisation.^[If you have internet access you can look at the organisation's website https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/who-mortality-database]

Mortality statistics distinguish between infant- and child-mortality. If a child dies within
the first year of his life, this is classified and counted as an infant death and the statistics
is referred to as infant-mortality statistics. If a child dies before its fifth year
this is classified as child-mortality. 

Mortality statistics are reported in different formats. Often the concept of a *mortality-rate* is used
in such reports. These are usually mortality rates 
standardized to 1000 life births. To compute an infant mortality rate in a given year in a given
geographic area one would, for instance, need to know how many babies were born alive in a given
period in a given area and how many babies who were born alive died before their first birthday during
the same period. The number of deaths is the divided by the number of births. This rate is then multiplied
by 1000, so that the rate reflects the number of infant deaths per 1000 life births in a standardized 
manner. This is just a reporting convention. We also could multiply by 10.000 of 100.000 depending on
the level of comparison that is required. Reporting mortality statistics as mortality rates
has the advantage that it communicates the risk as an expected frequency. 
Instead of percentages of probabilities it conveys directly what it means, for example, for 1000 births. 

The production and reporting of mortality statistics is a modern phenomenon. 
In many countries there are now statistical registry systems that record
infant-deaths in legally regulated processes. But this is not the case all over
the world. Poorer countries find it hard to have such processes in place. Still
for these countries, where no registry data are available, the United Nations Health Organisation conduct high quality surveys that allow a fairly precise estimate of
infant mortality rates. We will learn later in the course how you can draw conclusions from a survey to the whole population with a certain confidence. Today using either registry data of surveys we know a lot more about infant mortality based on a rich amount of data.

Historically 
these statistics can only be based on estimation and proxies of different and varied sources.
In a scientific publication Anthony Volk 
and Jeremy Atkinson made an attempt  to report mortality 
rates of infants and children in the past, collecting data from a wide 
range of geographic locations and cultures reaching far
back in history [@VolAtk2013]. 

The authors find that in the entire sample about 27 % of children 
died in their first year of life and 46 % died before they reached adulthood. These
numbers are surprisingly  similar across regions and cultures: Every forth newborn child died in the
first year of life, every second child during its early childhood. These high
mortality rates are a major cause of the slow population growth of past
centuries before the onset of the industrial revolution at around 1800.

Let us have a look at the data which we have collected and compiled from
gapminder and the website our world in data.^[The files are at
https://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdata002.xlsx  and
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/infant-mortality/infant-mortality.csv. From the
file name extensions you can see that the first file is an Excel sheet whereas
the second file is a comma separated text file. Both file formats
can be read by a computer. We will learn soon how to do this. For the moment let
this data work be conducted in the background and just look at some numbers from the
file I have compiled from these sources.] When we do this we only get
data for a small group of countries.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-infant-mortality-1860
#| tbl-cap: Infant mortality in some European countries in 1860
#| message: false

# Load our project  data library and the tidyverse

library(JWL)
library(tidyverse)

# read data from data folder. The data are a csv version of the excel file from gapminder
# sheet data

infant_mortality <- infant_mortality_data

# make table for the year 1860 and throw away all countries where there are no observations
# and select the variables Country, Continent, Mortality

dat <- infant_mortality[infant_mortality$Year == 1860, ]
rate_1860 <- dat[ , c("Country", "Continent", "Mortality")] %>% na.omit()

# make a table

library(knitr)
kable(rate_1860, digits = 4, row.names = FALSE)

# write a csv file of the table to the project table folder for further use by Seitwerk

write.csv(rate_1860, file = "tables/table_2_1_infant_mortality_1860.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The table shows infant mortality in the year 1860 as percent in decimal notation. So 0.124, for example, means 12.4 %. This is the percentage of infant deaths in Sweden in 1860. It is better than the
historical numbers reported by [@VolAtk2013] but still fairly high. Others at that time bigger countries
with a much more heterogeneous population like Germany and Austria were pretty much at where the rates had
always been in the past. The countries for which we have data from 1860 are all in Europe. 
Some of the bigger countries by this time had begun
to register and report infant deaths in a mortality statistics.

Before we deal with the information conveyed by these data, let us take the
opportunity to discuss some terminology and technical terms that we will always use
when we deal with tabular data like the ones shown in @tbl-infant-mortality-1860. 

The columns of the table have names. In our case these names are: Country, Continent and Mortality.
These names are called our **variables**. In the specific
example shown here we have data that record whether an event has happened or not, in our case the
death of an infant in his first year of life in a specific country during a specific year. 
Variables that can take only two values, are called **binary data**. Sets of binary data can
be summarized by the number of times and the percentage^[Remember from school mathematics 
that a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted by the
percentage sign %. A percentage is a dimensionless number. It has no unit of measurement. For
example 45 % is the fraction $\frac{45}{100}$ or 0.45. Percentages are often used to express
a proportionate part of the total. Thus when we see in the table that the mortality rate in
Germany in the year 1860 is 0.260 this is expressed in percent as 26 %.] of cases in 
which an event has occurred.

Each row in the table
is a **record** or sometimes also called an **observation**. Our table shown here has eight records. 
For doing statistics, especially when using the computer, it is often useful to display 
data tables such that each variable is a column and each record is a row.^[Such a format is
not always the reader friendliest to humans. Thus data on the web are often 
organized differently. For example the Gapminder data show the Years as columns and countries
as rows. While easier to read such a table for us, for working with the computer this deviation from
the format variable as column and observation as row, often creates problems. We will come back
to this seemingly minor but in fact quite important point over and over again. 
Hadley Wickham [@JSSv059i10], who
has contributed a lot to R and the R programming language which we will use in 
this course has popularized
the term "tidy" for the table format where every column is a variable and every row is an
observation.]

In this chapter we will use counts and proportions as the leading example to discuss the
basic presentation of statistics and data. We will learn about alternative ways to display data.
You will learn how design choices for the display of data help or prevent engagement and 
readability for your respective audience. You will also learn the 
first steps in R and how to use the computer to analyze and communicate data.

## Communicating Counts and Proportions

Let us follow the history of infant mortality around the globe. When we looked at the year 1860
rates of infant mortality were very high, not much better than it had been all the centuries
before industrialization has set in in Europe. 

But then about 100 years later we already see a significant reduction in the Western countries, 
with rates reduced still much further until now in the most affluent countries. Let us look at 
the country group for which we had data in 1860 already, again today in 2020,
before we go to the global picture. We will use this example to discuss some important aspects
of communication counts and proportions. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-infant-mortality-2020
#| tbl-cap: Infant mortality in some European countries in 2020.
#| warning: false

# Select the country group used in the historical 1860 data

rate_2020 <- infant_mortality[infant_mortality$Country %in% rate_1860$Country & infant_mortality$Year == 2020, c("Country", "Continent", "Mortality")]

# display the table and write text file of table

library(knitr)
kable(rate_2020, digits = 4, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(rate_2020, file = "tables/table_2_2_infant_mortality_2020.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

This is a spectacular improvement for this group of countries. By 2020 we have much more data, covering
more regions and we will follow the global story later. But let us stick for the moment with this
group of European Countries, which we followed over a time span of 160 year.

Within a bit more than a century the
mortality rate has been reduced from 30 % to below 0.3 %. This amounts to 
a reduction by a factor of about 100. Isn't this a stunning achievement?

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

This is a good opportunity to practice and refresh your skills in manipulating
percentages. Compute and report the reduction in the share of infant mortality for
each of the 8 countries between 1860 and 2020 based on the numbers reported in
@tbl-infant-mortality-1860 and @tbl-infant-mortality-2020

:::

In a recent book [@Smil2020], the Canadian researcher Vaclav Smil
has pointed out that such low rates are impossible 
without the combination
of a number of critical conditions, such as good healthcare in general, appropriate 
prenatal, perinatal and neonatal^[prenatal is a word rooted in ancient Latin and means
before birth. Perinatal means around the time of birth and neonatal means the
first month after birth of a child.] care, proper maternal and infant nutrition, adequate 
sanitary living conditions as well as access to social support for 
disadvantages families. All of
these factors require relevant government and private spending and on 
infrastructures that can be  universally used and accessed. Infant mortality is thus a very powerful 
indicator of quality of life in a country.

When data, such as counts and proportions are reported in a table we should make careful
considerations how the data are precisely presented. 

For instance in the table about infant mortality in some European countries in 1860,
we could have reported the same information by
presenting survival rates instead of mortality rates. Such a choice in reporting is 
generally known as **framing**. 

Framing can have effects on the impact of communication. 
Depending on how you frame the communication of data, the same information might 
affect and engage your audience differently. The same table with survival rates instead
of mortality rates would the look like this.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-infant-survivial-rate-1860
#| tbl-cap: Infant survival rates in some European countries in 1860
#| warning: false

srate_1860 <- rate_1860
srate_1860$Survival <- 1 - rate_1860$Mortality

# table for 1860 survival rates

srate_1860 <- with(srate_1860, srate_1860[ , c("Country", "Continent", "Survival")])

library(knitr)
kable(srate_1860, digits = 4, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(srate_1860, file = "tables/table_2_3_infant_survival_1860.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Take for instance the data for Germany 1860. If we had
reported a survival rate of 74 % it might sound to many better than if we had reported the
equivalent information of a mortality rate of 26 %. So whenever you report
counts or proportions be mindful of framing effects.

Risk impression can often be made more clear if we report expected frequencies as well  
as percentages. In this way the risk can be imagined as an actual crowd of
people. For example we could visualize the infant mortality rate in Germany by creating
a picture of the mortality rate, the actual number of cases per 1000 life births. If there are
relatively few cases, as in 2020 Germany, this arbitrary normalisation leads to an artificial number
such as 3.1 deaths per 1000 life births. Of course this is an artifact of the normalisation because there
is nothing as an event with 0.1 deaths. If we had normalized to 10000 this would amount to 31 in 10000 which
sounds more like an actual count. So for the visualization we take an infant mortality rate as infant deaths per 1000 life births to be 3.

Such a visualization could then look for example like this:

```{r}
#| label: infant-mortality-isotype-1860
#| fig-cap: In 1860 in Germany among 1000 newborns 
#|          260 infants died in the first year of their life.

library(waffle)

waffle(c("Death" = 260, "Survived" = 740), 
       rows = 20, colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#93FB98"), 
       use_glyph = "child", 
       glyph_size = 4, equal = F)
```
Here you visualize the numbers as differently colored crowds. There are 20 rows with 50
people symbols each. This multiplies to a crowd of 1000 people. It makes the magnitude
of the mortality rate (as well as the survival rate) tangible. The share of infant death
per 1000 life births in Germany in 1860 becomes now more tangible than reporting
just a percentage in a table.

When you plot the
same graph for the data of 2020 the enormous improvement that took place within a time
span of one and a half centuries in Germany become perhaps more obvious than just looking at the
rates alone. The same kind of visualization for the 2020 data would then look like this

```{r}
#| label: infant-mortality-isotype-2020
#| fig-cap: In 2020 in Germany among 1000 newborns 3 infants died in the first year of their life.

library(waffle)
waffle(c("Death" = 3, "Survived" = 997), rows = 20, colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#93FB98"), use_glyph = "child", glyph_size = 4, equal = F)
```

From this perspective the improvement in infant mortality rates in Germany are truly spectacular. 

Still
even at the low mortality rate this can mean a huge amount of individual tragedies. In 2020 Germany had
760.378 births. 0.31 % of this amounts to 2357 individual tragedies. Even if this rate could be
brought down further, say to 0.28 % which sounds like a tiny improvement, it would mean 228 infant lives
that could be saved.

## Now you try

David Spiegelhalter [@Spi2019] whose book we have encountered when we discussed the question of how many
trees there are on the planet, describes an advertisement in the London Underground, saying that 99 % of
young Londoners do not commit serious crimes. The add was presumably intended to reassure passengers 
that riding on the London Underground is very safe. Try to imagine what this statement would mean
when you think about this information in terms of crowds of young Londoners, assuming 
that "young" means between 15 and 25. Try to exlpain how the same information presented differently 
may have a different impact.
What kind of communication tools we have just heard about, have been applied here? 
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Seitwerk: A remark on answer.
Turn a positive frame into a negative one and then imagine actual crowds of people instead of percentages.
This or an answer like this I would have in mind that studnets come up with if they reflect this
example. I think an answer to such a reflection is best placed in the interactive part of the course
or in the study center meet ups.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
## Be mindful of framing

A standard we should strive for when reporting data is providing impartial information. 
For this
we should think carefully about our framing and should perhaps provide 
both positive and negative
frames.
:::

But even if we achieve this, we should consider other things, like the ordering
of the rows. Let us discuss this aspect in the next session together with
your first steps in R.


## A first acquaintance with R: Visualizing infant mortality rates 

While a table might be the medium of choice for displaying data  it is 
often more powerful to
convey information visually. The example of how imagining actual crowds might give us
sometimes a more tangible picture of the same information, was one illustration of this.

Today when we visualize data as one important tool of data exploration, the tool of choice
is a computer and an appropriate language that enables us to tell the computer what to do. 

For us in this course this will be the R language and now we start to learn the first steps 
in this language.

### Starting an quitting R

We assume that the computer you work with has a recent version of R installed. R will work
with the most common operating systems such as Windows, OSX or Linux.^[Installing R 
yourself is not complicated. To install R yourself you need a computer where you have the privileges to install software and you need an internet connection. You get the newest version of R at the website https://cran.r-project.org/. A screenshot of the website is here ![cran-website](pictures/cran-website-as-of-2022-09.png)] 

We will use R in two
ways: First from the R command line and then also by working 
with Jupyter Notebooks.^[Another very powerful and popular program to work with R and R code is RStudio, which you can find here https://www.rstudio.com/. RStudio is a so called IDE, an integrated development environment. If you have access to a computer with internet connection and the permissions to install software yourself, feel free to experiment also with this tool. The basic version is
free of charge. Again you need a computer where you have the privileges to install software and you need an internet connection.]

The
notebooks, which we already encountered in an example in the introduction, 
will not only allow to write R code and send this code to R for execution.  Notebooks also 
allows you to store commands, to comment them and make them available as files for later use. This
is especially useful, once you work on longer and more complicated tasks. It is then 
essential that you can reproduce what you did in the past days, that you can write
easily readable comments and that you can collaborate in a team, where you can share your work
with others. This circle of collaborators includes your future and past self.

For a start we just work with the R command line or the R-console, as it is called, introducing
the use of R via the notebooks a bit later. 

You start R by either typing `R` into the 
terminal or by clicking the R icon on your computer. The R console shows a prompt, a symbol
that looks like this `>`. When you see the prompt in the R console, R is ready to receive commands.

To end your R session write `quit()` at the 
prompt `>` of the console. Congratulations. Now that you can start and quit R we are ready to 
go.

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Seitwerk: A remark on a demo.
This would be perhaps best shown in a brief video. Of course when producing the video it is
important to think about which operating system the students will use, and the R version that they
will have available. If this is open, so the demo for windows, mac and linux. It does only take
marginally more time and effort. Maybe this whole intro is perfect for a video demo.
:::

### First steps

Here is an easy command you can send to R. Just try to type `1 + 1` at the prompt

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
1 + 1
```

Sure enough, R gives you the result of the addition, which is `2`. But what is
`[1]`? This is just a row label. If there were more outputs to your command, then they
would be labelled [2], [3], [4], and more. We will go into this aspect of R's output display later
in more detail. 

So R can do all the
usual computations. For instance if you knew that in Germany in 1860 there were 270
infant death per 1000 life birth you could compute the mortality rate in a 
decimal format by dividing the counts by 
1000, because the convention is to report mortality as cases per 1000 life briths. The R command for division is `/`. So by typing

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
270/1000
```

you will get the mortality rate `0.27` or 27 %.

You can do all the usual arithmetic operations, like with a calculator in R. For instance subtraction

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

3-2
```

Or multiplication

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

10*10
```

You can raise a number to the power of another, like

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
3^2
```

and of course you can combine all of these operations:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
(1+3)^2 - 5*4 + 12^3 - (13/2)
```

The comma is represented in R as a dot `.`. So the above output reads `1717`and one half or `0.5`.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

Use R to transform the Mortality numbers reported in percent in @tbl-infant-mortality-1860 and
@tbl-infant-mortality-2020 in mortality rates, i.e. the (approximate) 
number of infant-deaths per 1000 life births.
:::

R needs a complete command to be able to execute it, when the return key is pressed. 
Lets see what happens, if a command is incomplete, like for instance:

`5*`

In this case R will show the expression `5*` followed by a `+` instead of showing a new prompt. This
means that the expression is incomplete. When R shows `+` after entering a command instead of 
the output and a new prompt, it means that it expects more input.
If we complete the expression, the expression can be evaluated and a new prompt is shown in the console.

If you type a command that R does not understand, you will be returned an error message. Errors are
usually printed in red, and it instinctively might create a feeling of alarm.
Don't worry if you see an error message. It just is a way the computer tells you that he does 
not understand what you want him to do.

For instance, if you type `5%3` you will get an error message like this

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| error: true

5%3
```

Sometimes it is obvious why a mistake occurred. In this case, that R just does not 
know what to do with
the symbol `%`. It has no meaning in this context. Sometimes it is 
not so obvious what the error
message actually means and what you might do about it. 

A useful strategy in this 
case is to type
the error message into a search engine and see what you can find. The chance is very 
high that others
encountered the same problem before you and got helpful advice how to fix it from other users on 
the internet. One site, which is particularly helpful for all kinds of questions related to R
and R programming is https://stackoverflow.com/. Try it at the next opportunity.

With this knowledge we can already do a first example, by continuing our discussion
on infant mortality data we started in this lecture. On the way we learn a few more
things about R and the R language.

### Storing and reusing results

When our operations become just a bit more complex than just typing in a simple arithmetic
operation, it becomes useful if we can store answers and use these answers, which might be an intermediate
result of some transformed data or something else. In R this problem is solved very easily. We
*assign* the answer to a name we choose ourselves. Here is an example.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
a <- 1+1
```

The symbol `<-` tells R pleas assign to the name `a` the result of the computation `1+1`.^[The assignment
operator is used so often that it is useful to type it using a keyboard shortcut instead of typing 
first `< `and then `-`. The same result can be achieved by pressing the `ALT`key followed by the `- ` key. ]

Now see why we have said that the assignement has stored your result. Enter on your keyboard the name
you have just chosen:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
a
```

And you can use the stored value to do further computations with it, like

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
a^2
```

When you assign a new value to the old name `a`, the old value will be overwritten by the new value.

What names should you use? You could uses actually anything but you have to follow a few rules. A name in 
R must for example not begin with a number, a dot  `.` or an  underscore `_`. So for example `var_1`, `var.1`, `var1` and `VAR1` and `myVar1` are all allowed names but `1var`, `.var` and `_var1` are not

### A first data visualization

We showed the infant mortality rates of a group of European countries before 
in @tbl-infant-mortality-1860 and
@tbl-infant-mortality-2020. 

Humans
are very visual creatures. Thus using our visual system to explore data and absorb 
information in these data visualizations can be very powerful. To deploy their power, we must
- however - follow some principles, which we will learn step by step over this course.

Assume we would like to display the information in our tables in a so called **bar chart**. A bar chart
would combine in a plot bars for each country in the table with the bar length proportional to
the mortality rate. This will give us a visual impression how the countries differ in one
view, which might be more informative as just looking at the numbers themselves in
a table.

#### Functions

R is not just a calculator and data storage device. What makes R very powerful is that it
comes equipped with many functions which we can use to do things with data, like for instance
producing plots like a bar chart.

Functions in R have a name followed by parenthesis. In the very first step we typed for example `quit()` at
the prompt. This is a function and by typing its name followed by the parenthesis, R knows that it has to
close the program and shut down.

Functions can also have arguments, which we can assign certain values to. For example, R has a function
which would round numbers. This function is called `round()`. It has also arguments. You need to tell
R which numbers to round and the number of digits the rounding should consider.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

round( x = 2.4356789123456, digits = 2)
```

The first argument in the function `round` is `x`. We can give `x` a value, which we assign by `=`. The second argument is called `digits` and we assign to it the value `2`. The output is then, not very surprisingly, `2.44`.

Note that R is programmed such that we could also have typed:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

round(2.4356789123456, 2)
```

R would have known automatically that the first value is assigned to `x`and the second to `digits`.

We will encounter a lot of R functions during this course. We will also learn how to access
R documentation to know for so many different functions, what is their name, which arguments they accept as
input and how we can use them.

#### Visualizing the infant mortality data

R has a built in function for plotting bar charts, which is called `barplot()`. Let is make use of this
function to show the infant mortality rates of 1860 as a bar chart. The arguments taken by R are 
the data. Then we can add additional arguments which determine details of the plot display and 
appearance.

Let us first store the data in an object with the name `mr`for mortality rates of 1860. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mr_1860 <- c(0.237, 0.139, 0.136, 0.150, 0.260, 0.102, 0.174, 0.124)
```

Here we see another important function of R which we will need all of the time, the `c()`function. This
function concatenates values in a vector of values. So the output of the operation will be a vector
$(0.237, 0.139, 0.136, 0.150, 0.260, 0.102, 0.174, 0.124)$ with the name `mr_1860`. Thus when we type

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

mr_1860
```

R will print the whole vector as one object. This is why the counting label is [1] and not [8]. The `c()` function concatenates the number so a single object, a vector containing all eight numbers.^[In case
you are worried about the technical term of a vector, don't worry. We use this term here losely and
not in a rigorous mathematical sense. You can think for the moment of a vector in R as a single
object that can hold several data at once, like numbers, or characters. I avoided the term list
in the text to avoid confusion with the list data structure which is a special data structure in R which
we learn about in the course later.]

Now lets see what happens when we give `mr_1860`  as an argument to `barplot`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

barplot(mr_1860)
```
We see on the y axis the infant mortality rates from 0 to 0.25 and on the x axis a bar for each country
with a length proportional to the infant mortality rate in this country.

But here it is difficult to connect the bars to the countries. So let us store the country names in 
another vector and call them `ctr`

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
ctr <- c("Austria", "Belgium", "Denmark", "France", 
         "Germany", "Norway", "Spain", "Sweden")
```

Note that the names of the countries had to be written between quotation marks `" "`. This is the 
way to tell R that the
sequence of letters are characters. Characters are a specific data type representing text. Now we have a 
vector of words, the country names. We can give the country names as an argument to `barplot()`like this:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
barplot(mr_1860, names.arg = ctr)
```
Not too bad. But some country names are missing. It seems that the width of the
bars is not wide enough that R is able to print all names. 

It would be more convenient
to flip the chart around and interchange the x and the y axes here. This can be done by another
argument to `barplot()`. This argument is called `horiz` and it assumes a logical value. A logical
is another R data type which allows us to express whether something is true or false. Logical true and
false values are expressed as `TRUE` and `FALSE` in R.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
barplot(mr_1860, names.arg = ctr, horiz = TRUE)
```
This does not yet help much, because this flip of coordinates can only support a better 
display of the data if the country names
are also printed horizontally. 

You might guess it already: This can be controlled by another argument
which is called in the case of this function `las`. If `las` gets value 1 we get what we want.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
barplot(mr_1860, names.arg = ctr, horiz = TRUE, las = 1)
```

Now we have visualized the information we had displayed in a table before. It is not yet perfect
because the names of countries with longer names are cut off a bit. This could be fixed by
additional function arguments, but let us not go too much in the details of the
`barplot()`function at this stage. We will learn a lot about powerful visualization
techniques in R as we go along.

## Now you try

Use R to redo the barplot visualization we just did for the 1860 data for the 2020 data.
:::

Before we close this first encounter with R and data visualization, let me point out an
important aspect of bar charts. The visual impression is powerful and truthful, if we choose
the origin of the bars carefully. It is usually the best idea to start the bars at zero. So we see
clearly the relative lengths and the magnitude of differences in the context of the entire dataset.

Changing the origin with not enough care can visually exaggerate the differences between countries. This
is a manipulative visualization, which should be avoided but which is encountered often. So be mindful
about the choice of origin in a bar chart. 

Let me show you what I mean by telling R, for example, to start the plot of the data for the
1880 data at $0.08$ instead as of $0$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
barplot(mr_1860, names.arg = ctr, horiz = TRUE, las = 1, 
        xlim = c(0.08, 0.275), xpd = F)
```

Do you see that now the differences appear bigger? The choice of origin can have a big influence
on the appearance of differences between the length of the bars. Always be mindful of this effect and
reflect what happens if for some reason you have to choose a different origin for the bar chart
than zero. Alberto Cairo, who is the author of an influential book on data visualization [@Cai2016] recommends to always choose a "...*logical and meaningful baseline*". 

:::{.callout-important}
## Be mindful in choosing a logical and meaningful origin for barcharts

When you compare porportions visually with a bar chart always think of choosing a logical
and meaningful origin. In most cases this will be 0. If 0 is not possible, think about what
would be a choice that gives a truthfull and not exaggerated display of differences.
:::

Before we close this digression into visualization, let me briefly discuss another aspect 
of data presentation which you need to consider. The ordering of the rows in the 
data table, or in this case, the
order of the bars in the barchart has to be carefully considered. 

If you look at the bar chart we have
produced, you see that the bars have an order corresponding to the alphabetical 
order of the countries, starting with A for Austria and ending with S for Sweden. 

Now consider we had ordered the data according to mortality rate like this:

```{r}
barplot(rate_1860[order(-rate_1860$Mortality) , ]$Mortality, 
        names.arg = rate_1860[order(-rate_1860$Mortality) , ]$Country, horiz = TRUE, las = 1)
```
Now the bar chart could suggests that the infant mortality rate is an important and meaningful way of 
comparing this particular group of countries. 

Such ranking comparisons are very popular in the media 
but they can be misleading. They can be misleading because the differences could be there just by
chance. 

There could be also systematic differences between countries affecting infant mortality rates. For
example, countries that are small with populations under 10 Million and that have 
very homogeneous populations and low birth rates tend to show lower infant mortality rates
just because of these demographic features. So an ordering like the one presented 
in the graph might suggest
a ranking that is in fact spurious and is not really substantial.

:::{.callout-important}
## Be mindful about order in displaying the data

When you display proportions in a table or a bar chart be mindful of the ordering
of data and avoid spurious rankings. Choose a particular ordering only if there is
a meaningful and logical reason to do so.
:::

## Categorical variables: Causes of infant mortality

We have discussed binary data. These are data that can take two values, like death or alive, in the
examples of infant mortality data we have studied so far. A generalization of binary variables are
called **categorical variables** in statistics. Categorical variables are measures that can take two or
more values, which can be either unordered, such as eye color, countries or study center
locations at which JWL courses take place. They can also be ordered, like positions in a hierarchy.

An example of categorical data arises if we study the issue of infant mortality further and ask for
the causes. Why do infants die in the first year of their life?

Here are the causes that have been registered by the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2019 by 
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as well as the share of each cause in the
overall cases.^[See https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/2019]

```{r}

# read data from JWL package

library(JWL)
causes <- infant_mortality_causes
# order by share
causes_ordered <- causes[order(-causes$Share) , ]

dat <- causes_ordered[, c("Entity", "Share")]
names(dat) <- c("Cause", "Share")

library(knitr)
kable(dat, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(dat, file = "tables/table_2_4_infant_mortality_causes.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

Use R to visualize this table in a barchart. Don't worry if some of the causes are cut off at
the left of the graph. We will learn during the course how to better control the appearance
of a visualization and control for details like this.
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## This is how an answer can look like.
Since students have not yet learned subsetting, they need to use the table and retype the values and
the causes manually. This is intended because it will familiarize them with the `c()` function, the 
difference between numerical and character data type and is an excellent opportunity to review what
we did on simple R bar-charts. In the example cause below I use - of course - the convenience
of subsetting

```{r}
barplot(dat$Share, 
        names.arg = dat$Cause, horiz = TRUE, las = 1, cex.names = 0.3)
```


:::

In the news but also in many publications you will often find proportions and how
they add up to a total represented in so called pie charts. A pie chart for the
causes of infant mortality visualizing our data will look like this

```{r}
pie(dat$Share, labels = dat$Cause, radius = 1, cex = 0.5)
```

Now compare this to a display of the same information using the bar chart. If 
you have done the exercise before correctly, it will look like this

```{r}
barplot(dat$Share, 
        names.arg = dat$Cause, horiz = TRUE, las = 1, cex.names = 0.5)
```

Apart from some imperfections of displaying the labels in a easily readable way, why
does the bar chart work much better for comparing the proportions of causes than the
pie chart?

The reason is that the bar chart is supported better by by our visual perception
capacity. In the case of the bar chart we have to compare lengths, which our visual
system can do well. For decoding the pie we have to compare areas of slices or
angles formed by the slices at the circle center. But our visual system does not work well
for such tasks. It works even worse, if the display is a three dimensioal pie chart,
as offered by various apps. In this case the pie would look like this:

```{r}
library(plotrix)
pie3D(dat$Share, labels = dat$Cause, radius = 1, labelcex = 0.5)
```

Now it is even worse, because our visual system now has to additionally decode 
perspective on top of area, something it is naturally also not good at.

There are ways to visually display data that work because they are naturally 
supported by our ability of visual perception and cognition, while others are
not.

:::{.callout-important}
## Don't use pie charts to visually compare proportions

When you display proportions choose bar charts and avoid pie charts. Bar charts
are naturally supported by the ability of our visual system to compare lengths,
while pie charts require the comparison of areas and angles, a task our visual 
system is not so good at.
:::

## Compairing pairs of proportions

Often proportions or percentages are used to communicate risks by comparing
pairs of proportions.

When pairs of proportions are compared, we need to understand how such
comparisons can be made in a meaningful way. Especially in the media
it is popular to often run spectacular headlines of how specific
behaviors affect your likelihood of developing a disease.

Much of the spectacle in the headlines is due to the exclusive reporting of 
*relative risks*. It is important to understand that such statements 
need to be put into context by also reporting baseline of *absolute* risk.

Let me illustrate the issue using the example of consuming processed meat and the
risk of developing bowel cancer. 

From epidemiological research it is known that the chance of a person of developing
bowel cancer is based on factors such as meat consumption, the level of physical
activity, the body weight or income. 

The *relative risk* is the risk of developing bowel cancer in a group of people 
compared to another group of people with different behaviors, different physical conditions
of different environments.

For instance when we compare meat eaters versus vegetarians, a statement about relative
risk would be that the consumption of processed meat increases the risk of developing
bowel cancer by 18 %. This sounds spectacular but it does not tell the full story.

To see this go back to our previous example of imagining crowds of people instead of
percentages. 

```{r}
waffle(c(2, 8), rows = 2, use_glyph = "male", 
       colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#93FB98"), glyph_size = 16, 
       equal = F, legend_pos = "")
```
Here we have an *absolute risk* of two out of 10 persons developing bowel cancer.
If the relative risk would increase by 50 % this would mean in terms of
absolute risk that now we have

```{r}
waffle(c(2, 1, 7), rows = 2, use_glyph = "male", 
       colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#3A9ABD", "#93FB98"), glyph_size = 16, equal = F, legend_pos = "", size = 0.2)
```

The risk increases now to three out of 10.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Now you try

Assume the absolute risk is 4 out of 10 and the relative risk increase is 50 %. How many out of 10 are now at risk? 
:::

These examples illustrate that you need baseline or absolute risks as a vital 
information to understand what an 18 % increase in risk really means. 

Going back to the example of processed meat consumption and bowel cancer risk, the
estimated lifetime risk of developing bowel cancer is 5.6 %. Expressed as a
relative frequency this is about 6 out of 100 or in a chart

```{r}
waffle(c(6, 94), rows = 5, use_glyph = "male", 
       colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#93FB98"), glyph_size = 8, 
       equal = F, legend_pos = "")
```
The estimated life time risk of developing bowel cancer if you eat 50 g of processed meat 
per day increases your relative risk by 18 %. At this heigthened risk level the new
absolute risk is now 6.6 % or about 7 out of 100

```{r}
waffle(c(6, 1, 93), rows = 5, use_glyph = "male", 
       colors = c("#FD6F6F", "#3A9ABD", "#93FB98"), glyph_size = 8, 
       equal = F, legend_pos = "")
```

In the research literature proportions are often expressed by the *odds ratio*.
This ratio expresses the chance of an event happening relative to the chance of
an event not happening. In the example of processed meat and bowel cancer this would
be $6/94$, because 6 out of hundered people develop bowel cancer in their life time
and 94 out of hundred do not. While odds are very common in the research literture they
are not a very intuitive way to communicate the comparison of proportions. Spiegelhalter, from whom I took this example therefore recommends not to use odds ratios outside
a scientific context, since it easily invites misunderstanding.

## Activities in the study center

### The story of infant mortality around the globe

For this activity we continue to look into the issue of infant mortality around the
globe by working with a Jupyter notebook. To work on this assignment, please open
the notebook `infant_mortality_global.ipynb` with the jupyter notebook. 
The notebook contains some text and some code which you can interactively 
execute from the notebook, as we already did it in the assignments 
in the Introduction, when we looked at the share of
poverty in various countries. In this notebook we continue to dive deeper into the
story of infant mortality around the globe. The things you learn when you work through 
this assignment will probably surprise you.
