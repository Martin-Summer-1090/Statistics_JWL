title: "extreme poverty around the world"
---

The following grey box contains R code to generate a plot of the share
of extreme poverty in the world from 2000-2017 (or for some countries where the
data are available even longer than that). Don't worry, if you don't know or 
understand what the code precisely means. This is something you will learn step
by step as we work with R.

You can write in the grey box and exchange the word "China" for example by
another country you might be interested in, say "Turkey". Then save the file and
press the green arrow to see what happens.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

demo_data <- read.csv("../data/extreme_poverty/share-of-population-in-extreme-poverty.csv")

names(demo_data) <- c("Country", "Code", "Year", "Share")

pl_dat <- with(demo_data, demo_data[Country %in% c("World", "China") & Year >= 2000, ])

p <- ggplot(pl_dat, aes(x = Year, y = Share, color = Country)) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_line() +
     xlab("")

p
```
