# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are lecture notes for an introductory statistics and data literacy 
course I have been developing as a volunteer for the Pres-Stem Program of
Jesuit Worldwide Learning (JWL, https://www.jwl.org/). These notes are input 
for a series of 8 learning units, provided in a digital format 
by JWL's service provider Seitwerk (https://www.seitwerk.de/de/home). 
together with my colleagues from Seitwerk. 

I would like to thank
Peter Balleis, Mathias Beck, Martha Habash, Stefan Hengst Anna Mayr and
Reda Daugelaviciute for all their generous help and support
in kickstarting this challenging project. The course has first been
run in the Spring-term of 2024 and will be part of a new Pre-Stem course
program in the collection of courses provided and taught in the overall
program of JWL.

The goal of the notes is to develop the core contents of 
the course systematically and to support
the production of the online units. I also write up in 
these notes material and instructions for
teaching material, which is meant to be used in the local study centers. 


For the time being it is more like a systematic notebook and a scenario. 
This is a first, yet unstable version of the notes. They certainly will
need more than one overhaul in the months and years to come.
This archive helps me to keep a better overview of the overall 
development of the text.

Mainly for the interaction with
my past and future self, I keep a versioning of the notes on this 
public github archive, which may
also be accessed by interested colleagues, other users of GitHub
and of course by the Seitwerk team.
