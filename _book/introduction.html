<p>What is the biggest source of electricity production in Kenya? Answering this question needs data, listing and recording various forms of electricity production in specific countries. An internationally acknowledged organisation, which collects and reports these data is the International Energy Agency (IEA). If you have access to the internet, you can look up data and reports by the IEA for instance at it’s website https://www.iea.org/, where it host a special category called <em>data</em> which you can look up and consult.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a quiz and guess. What do you think is actually the biggest source of electricity production in Kenya?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Coal</li>
<li>Renewable energy</li>
<li>Natural gas</li>
</ol>
<p>Consulting the IEA data, you will find that the correct answer is <em>renewable energy</em>. A very interesting website called <em>gapminder</em> (https://www.gapminder.org/), which analyzes the answers of many people to this question, finds that 61 % give a wrong answer to this question. Maybe they find it hard to imagine that 80 % of energy production in Kenya is already fossil free thanks to huge sources of geothermal and hydropower. Even if you break the answers down by country you see that 38 % of people from Kenya get the answer wrong. Among the people from the UK, who answer this question even 72 % answer wrongly.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with some of the vocabulary used here, like geothermal, hydropower or even if you are not completely sure how to interpret a number like 38 %, don’t worry. The point here is that you see that one useful consequence of being able to access, read and interpret data is that it can help to establish facts about the world and help us to perhaps correct misconceptions we might have had about these facts. I encourage you to visit https://www.gapminder.org/ at some occasion when you have access to the internet. You will be surprised how often you might have a wrong guess about basic facts in the world.</p>
<p>In this course you will learn how to work with data and how to learn from these data in a systematic way. Learning from data entails more than just establishing facts. This might not always be possible, either because you cannot access the relevant data or you cannot completely access them, since doing so would be way too expensive. Think about the following interesting example, which I learned from a wonderful book by the British statistician David Spiegelhalter <span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">(<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">Spiegelhalter 2019</a>)</span>. The example shows that even categorizing and labeling can be challenging. The basic question raised in this book is: How many trees are there on the planet?</p>
<p>It is clear that answering this question is more challenging than the task of the IEA had to solve in listing energy sources by country around the world. But even before you go about to think how this could be done you have to answer an even more basic question, namely: What is a tree? Some of you might think this is a silly and obvious question, which every child can answer when it sees a tree. But what some might consider a tree others will consider just a bush. Turning experience into data requires rigorous definitions. It turns out that such definitions can be given for trees. But even with the definition at hand you cannot go around the planet and count every plant that meets the criteria. So this is what the researchers investigating that question did according to <span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">(<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">Spiegelhalter 2019</a>)</span>:</p>
<p>“…<em>They first took a series of of areas with a common type of landscape, known as a biome and counted the average number of trees per square kilometer. They then used satellite imaging to estimate the total area of the planet covered by each type of biome, carried out some complex statistical modelling, and eventually came up with an estimate of 3.04 trillion (3,040,000,000,000) trees on the planet. This sounds a lot, except that they reckoned there used to be twice this number</em>.”</p>
<p>Now imagine that if authorities need long discussions or even disagree about what the call a tree, you can imagine that more complex concepts such as unemployment or the definition of the total value of goods ans services produced in a country in a year, known as Gross Domestic Product or GDP, is even more challenging. There is no automatic way to turn experience into data and the statistics that we use and produce are constructed on the basis of judgement. It is a starting point for a deeper understanding of the world around us. This is one of the reasons why in this course statistics is not only referred to as science, which it arguably is to some degree but also as an art.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of data as a source of knowledge about the world is that anything we choose to measure will differ across places, across persons or across time. When analyzing and trying to understand data we will always face the problem how we can extract meaningful insights from this apparent random variation. One challenge faced by statistics and one core topic in this course will thus be how we can distinguish in data the important relationships from the background variability that make all single data points unique.</p>
<p>Exploring and finding such meaningful relationships or patterns in data using the science of statistics and computational tools is one of the skills you will learn in this course.</p>
<p>But finding relationships and patterns in data naturally leads to another set of skills that you acquire by learning statistics: Making predictions, which means using available data and information to make informed guesses about data and information we do not have.</p>
<p>Example, take falling trend in poverty, make prediction on the trend, show that corona for the first time in many years reversed the trend look for the gapminder example.</p>
<p>this can then lead to the third point, quantifying uncertainty.</p>
<p>Introduce the concept of statistics and give an overview what students will learn during the course. In the introductory unit I would like to include an activity on variation or an interesting visualization where students see the code (which they do not yet understand in detail) but can change certain details and experiment on the computer how the visualization changes. This will also provide a first check of whether the software and hardware work for each student. I would also like to discuss why statistics is important and get students involved by collecting data on them for use later in the course. I would like to have lots of involvement in the first unit to set expectations for plenty of participation.</p>
<p>The overall goals of this course might be described as follows: After successfully completing this course students will have learned new skills in three core pillars of statistics</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Data exploration or finding patterns in data and information through visualisation and computation.</p></li>
<li><p>Making predictions, which means using available data and information to make informed guesses about data and information we do not have.</p></li>
<li><p>To quantify the uncertainty we have to attach to our predictions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Simultaneously with these three core skills the students will learn to use the computer and modern computing tools to apply this knowledge to real world data. The combination of these skills will empower students to achieve a level of data literacy allowing them to independently work with new data and new situations they encounter in their professional life after completing the course or in their further studies.</p>
<p>As sources for my notes I rely very much on <span class="citation" data-cites="FrePisPur2009">(<a href="references.html#ref-FrePisPur2009" role="doc-biblioref">Freedman, Pisani, and Purves 2009</a>)</span> on <span class="citation" data-cites="Kap2009">(<a href="references.html#ref-Kap2009" role="doc-biblioref">Kaplan 2009</a>)</span> and in particular on Spiegelhalter’s wonderful exposition <span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">(<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">Spiegelhalter 2019</a>)</span> in terms of concepts and the logic how the concepts are developed. Important sources for examples are [<span class="citation" data-cites="BekKes2021">Bekes and Kezdi (<a href="references.html#ref-BekKes2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>], [<span class="citation" data-cites="GelNol2017">Gelman and Nolan (<a href="references.html#ref-GelNol2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>] as well as <span class="citation" data-cites="PeCa2005">(<a href="references.html#ref-PeCa2005" role="doc-biblioref">Peck et al. 2005</a>)</span> as well as <span class="citation" data-cites="AdhDen">(<a href="references.html#ref-AdhDen" role="doc-biblioref">Adhikari, DeNero, and Wagner</a>)</span>, who wrote the textbook for Berkeley’s introductory data science course Data08.</p>
<p>My vision would be to achieve a suitably adapted combination of Spiegelhalter and Adhikari, DeNero and Wagner. While the former is the didactically best exposition of statistics I have ever encountered, the latter is unmatched in explaining modern computational tools at a basic level. For this course, however both sources need to be substantially reworked. Spiegelhalter is written for a general audience of readers. Here we need to teach the concepts and actively involve students through exercises and projects they do themselves. I will thus follow the conceptual development logic of Spiegelhalter – and in this lecture note outline I have literally done so – but I would like to find a different and more interactive exposition with perhaps also different examples, nearer to the live context of students. Adhikari, DeNero and Wagner is for this course a bit too much tilted towards computation and perhaps not enough towards statistics. On the other hand this is a lightening rod for how I would like to see this course roughly turn out in terms of exposition and the use of the computational tools, in particular notebooks and coding style.</p>
