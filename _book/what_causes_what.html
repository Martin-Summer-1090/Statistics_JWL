<!-- ## Contents -->
<!-- In this lecture we discuss what causation means in a statistical sense, why we need be careful to distinguish between causation and correlation. -->
<!-- 1. Causation in a statistical sense means that when we intervene, the chances of different outcomes vary systematically. -->
<!-- 2. Causation is difficult to establish statistically, but well designed randomized trials are the best available framework. -->
<!-- 3.Principles that helped clinical trials to identify effects. -->
<!-- 4, Observational data may have background factors influencing the apparent relationships between exposure and outcome which may be either observed confounders or lurking factors. -->
<!-- 5. Statistical methods do not suspend judgment which is always required for the confidence with which causation can be claimed. -->
<!-- ## Outcome -->
<!-- This is a conceptually difficult topic. It is, however, not technically difficult but it will need lots of examples. Fortunately there are many good (and bad) real world examples that I hope will stick with the students as reference examples after the course. Students should understand the idea of randomized trials and observational studies as well as the general ideas of comparison in statistical analysis. -->
<p>The last two centuries brought enormous advances in the expansion of education around the world. Quantitative measures such as literacy rates, school enrollment, the share of education spending in GDP all point into the same direction: While access to education had been the privilege of a very small elite throughout history, things have changed in the direction of a very broad participation.</p>
<p>This is a result of both economic necessities of modern production as well as of political struggles for human rights and equality. Today education is perceived as a right and it is seen as a government duty to provide broad access to basic education. A certain amount of schooling is even compulsory in most countries, although not all the countries have the capacity to broadly enforce such obligations.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Despite all of these developments and efforts in the expansion of education there are still about 8 % of children worldwide which are not in school. Also progress has been heterogeneous across the globe, with literacy rates among the youth of sub Saharan Africa - for example - still below 50 %.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The data and an interesting analysis can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="Roser2021">Roser (<a href="references.html#ref-Roser2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> at https://ourworldindata.org/children-not-in-school</p></li></div></div>
<p>Education policies have thus been widely debated in international policy circles and have spurred debates as well as to seemingly unresolvable controversies about what is needed to further improve education for those who are still behind and precisely which policies would and would not work towards this goal.</p>
<p>For example, the majority view in international policy circles has been that the focus of education policy should be to get children into the class room and provide the necessary teachers. This entails policies to make sure that children have access to a school nearby as well as the free provision of basic education. Once this is assured, according to this approach, the rest will more or less follow automatically.</p>
<p>But enrollment does not automatically mean that all the children enrolled actually attend. For example, we know from the DHS, the demographic and health survey you learned about in previous lectures, that there is a gap between enrollment and attendance in the countries that have the most urgent need for improved education policies. From the surveys we also know that the absence is not necessarily driven by the fact that the children are needed at home.</p>
<p>Look at this graph compiled from DHS data provided by Our World in Data:</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This is an excellent opportunity to refresh some of the R skills you have required in this course so far. The data that were used to produce this picture are in the JWL-package.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load the JWL package</li>
<li>The dataset is called <code>enrol_attend_dat</code>. Use the R help function to study the data an the meaning of the variables as well as the original data source.</li>
<li>Can you write an R code reproducing the graphics? (Hint: Not everything you need to reproduce this plot was contained in the lectures. Try to use an internet search to find out for instance how to draw the blue line)</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the graph you see the enrolment rate in primary school at the x-axes and the attendance rate on the y-axes. If all children who are enrolled would also attend all the points would be on the blue line, showing all the points where the enrollment rate is equal to the attendance rate. In the data you see many observations where the attendance rate is below the enrolment rate and these observations are quite heterogeneous.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Another aspect that was debated is that enrollment does not necessarily mean that children actually learn something or that they learn at a sufficient quality. This problem of poor learning outcomes in many parts of the globe was demonstrated in many cases.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For details on the evidence you can for instance look at chapter 4 in the excellent book by <span class="citation" data-cites="BanerjeeDuflo2012">Banerjee and Duflo (<a href="references.html#ref-BanerjeeDuflo2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>Does this mean these policies are wrong, as their critics claim? They point out that there is no point in all this educational supply if there is no demand for it, taking lack of attendance and lack of sufficient learning outcomes as evidence. If there were demand, these critics argue, supply would follow and the demand arises by itself as soon as there are high enough returns to education.</p>
<p>Why can’t controversies like these not simply be resolved by looking at the data?</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-does-not-imply-causation"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Correlation does not imply causation</h2>
<p>Many data sources we have, just rely on education policy outcomes somebody has observed and recorded, so called <strong>observational studies</strong>. For instance, there is a large literature, mainly from before the mid 1990ies in education research, which tried to answer the following question: Do increased financial resources for public schools improve educational outcomes as measured by standard education achievement tests?</p>
<p>A look across countries would - for instance - give the following picture.</p>

<p>Indeed a study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Hedgesetal1994">Larry Hedges (<a href="references.html#ref-Hedgesetal1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> confirmed patterns like these.

<p>This is another excellent opportunity to refresh some of the R skills you have required in this course so far. The data that were used to produce this picture are in the JWL-package.</p>
<p>The dataset is called <code>expenditure_outcome_dat</code>. Use R to compute the correlation coefficient between public and private per capita expenditure of education and the average harmonized learning outcome. Explain what this number means.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But does this evidence support the conclusion that there is a causal relation between increased educational spending and student outcomes? There is a straightforward reason why this can not be the case.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>We compare very different students or schools across countries in the scatter plot we produced before. In the study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Hedgesetal1994">Larry Hedges (<a href="references.html#ref-Hedgesetal1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> the variables that were related were students from different households across different schools. In the plot we show here it is students from different households across different countries. For the general point we want to make here, this is immaterial. What matters is that simply comparing outcomes of students across countries or students across schools with different levels of spending does not tell us whether the different spending levels are causal for the variation in outcomes we observe. There may be many other differences between countries and students that are shaping this relationship.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;There are whole websites documenting examples where two variables are highly correlated but it is obvious that there can not be a causal relation.

<p>Statisticians have summarized this observation in the mantra that <strong>“correlation does not imply causation”</strong>. If we want to establish a causal relation from data we need to work harder.</p>

<p>When you ask a doctor today about the risks of smoking, he will usually give you a warning and advise against it. One of the arguments will be that the evidence shows that smoking causes lung cancer.</p>
<p>But assume you have been a smoker and now come into the unfortunate situation that you are diagnosed with lung cancer. How do you know that your lung cancer occurred, because you were smoking and you would not have got lung cancer anyway, perhaps for an entirely different reason?</p>
<p>It took the medical profession decades to accept the causality of smoking of lung cancer. The many studies that were undertaken on this subject since the 1930es usually compared people who smoke with non-smokers and tried to take conclusions about the effect from this comparison. In this comparisons the smokers came out badly, showing among many other things higher incidence of lung cancer. So many studies together established a strong correlation between smoking and lung cancer. If smoking cause lung cancer, this would be an explanation of the association between smoking and lung cancer. But this evidence is only circumstantial. There could be some hidden factor - so called <strong>confounding factor</strong> - which makes people smoke and also makes them get lung cancer. In this case there would be no point in quitting smoking.</p>
<p>The famous statistician Sir R.A. Fisher doubted the causal role of cigarettes for lung cancer and suggested possible confounding factors. Epidemiologists conducted careful studies that accumulated evidence that these confounding factors were not plausible. Over time the evidence taken together convinced the medical community that smoking is indeed causal for lung cancer. But causal here has a meaning that takes into account the unavoidable variability that underlies real life.</p>
<p>The statistical notion of causation or causality is not deterministic. If statisticians say there is evidence that smoking is causal for lung cancer it does not mean that every smoker will end up with lung cancer. It does also not mean that lung cancer can occur only if you are a smoker. It rather means that among the group of smokers lung cancer will occur more often. Thus we can not use statistical methods to establish causation in a specific case. The only thing we can possibly establish by data is that smoking increases the proportion of times lung cancer will occur in a population.</p>
<p>This has two important consequences for what needs to be done if we want to find out what causes what. We need to intervene, that is consciously change a variable, and perform experiments. But since we are in a situation of uncertainty we need to intervene more than once, to establish strong enough evidence.</p>
<p>For this reason much of research in medicine and epidemiology today relies on evidence gained from so called controlled experiments. Let us explain next what the ideas behind such an approach is. These ideas have also been extended to other fields, like the research on what works in policies attempting to improve education and to other fields.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Let us take an example from medicine first. Suppose a new drug is found and we would like to introduce it as a medication that can be prescribed by doctors to their patients.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;This discussion follows <span class="citation" data-cites="FrePisPur2009">Freedman, Pisani, and Purves (<a href="references.html#ref-FrePisPur2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span></p></li></div></div>
<p>The basic idea of testing the effectiveness of the medicine is <strong>comparison</strong>. An experiment is designed in which the medicine is given to a <strong>treatment group</strong>. But there are other subjects that are not treated and form another group, the <strong>control group</strong>. Then the responses of the two groups are compared. The assignemt of subjects to both groups should be <strong>random</strong> and the experiment should be run <strong>double blind</strong>: Neither the subjects nor the researchers who measure the response should know who was in the control group.</p>
<p>The key of randomization in this protocol is that it keeps the two groups equal except for the treatment. Then, if you measure different outcomes you can conclude with some confidence that the observed difference must be the result of the treatment. This would then establish causality.</p>
<p>One of the first epidemiological studies implementing these ideas was a randomized controlled experiment to show the effectiveness of a vaccine against polio in the US in 1954 . It was conducted by the Public Health Service and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFPI).</p>
<p>The field trial was conducted in select school districts throughout the country where the risk of polio was high. Two million children were involved and half a million were vaccinated. A million were deliberately left unvaccinated as controls, half a million refused vaccination.</p>
<p>Children could, however, only be vaccinated with their parents consent, so only children whose parents agreed to the vaccination could go into the treatment group. Parents with higher income were more likely to consent to treatment. This biases the design against the vaccine, since polio is a disease of hygiene. Children in more hygienic surroundings have less exposure to mild cases of polio in early childhood. This prevents the generation of antibodies which protect them against severe infections at a later age.</p>
<p>Many experts recognized the flaw in the design. The assignment to treatment and control was not random and thus the treatment and control group were systematically different. The idea, however, is that both groups should be as similar as possible except for treatment. If the two groups differ to some factor other than treatment this factor my <strong>confound</strong> or get mixed up with the effect of treatment.</p>
<p>To exclude the bias in assignment introduced by parental consent in the NFPI design, it was suggested that the control group has to chosen from the same population as the treatment group using an impartial chance procedure. Such an approach is called <strong>randomized controlled</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of double blindness was also already used in a new improved design. The children in the control group were given an injection of salt dissolved in water rather than the vaccine, a so called <strong>placebo</strong>. During the experiment therefore the subjects did not know whether they were in the control group or in the treatment group. Also the doctors were not told which group the child belonged to and neither knew those who evaluated the responses.</p>
<p>A subsequent program evaluation published in a scientific journal (<span class="citation" data-cites="Francis1955">Francis (<a href="references.html#ref-Francis1955" role="doc-biblioref">1955</a>)</span>), showed the bias in the NFPI study in comparison with the randomized controlled double blind experiment:</p>

<p>In the randomized controlled trial the vaccination cut the polio rate from 71 to 28 per hundred thousand. The NFPI study - by contrast - shows a reduction from 54 to 25 per hundred thousand.

<p>While randomized controlled trials have their origin in medical research and epidemiology, this is an approach that can be applied in other contexts to establish a causal effect. In such fortunate cases, it is possible to produce actual evidence that a certain policy works or not.</p>
<p>As an example consider an education policy program for the poor designed in Mexico in the 1990 called Progresa. The problem Progresa tried to address was how a reasonable support program could be designed to increase school enrollment among the poor.</p>
<p>It was known that school enrollment among the poor was low and that one reason for this low enrollment was that children needed to work to help supporting their families rather than going to school. This situation could be characterized as a kind of poverty trap because the income of the poor families is so low that they cannot afford to enroll the children in school which prevents them to get enough training and eventually higher incomes which can raise them out of poverty.</p>
<p>The Finance minister at that time, Santiago Levy, initiated a program trying to address this problem by designing education grants to poor mothers to support the increase of school enrollment of their children. The Progresa program tried to avoid some known problems of past poverty alleviation programs. If a transfer conditions on current income, this can for instance create an incentive against taking up a job. This can happen because if a recipient of the transfer joins the paid labor force the transfer is lost as earnings increase. This can lead to disincentives to attempts of joining the paid labor force.</p>
<p>The Progresa Program therefore tried to minimize disincentives to work by not conditioning the transfer on current income but only on an initial assessment of household poverty information. This approach was tried as an alternative to build more schools and augment other educational resources such as teachers and teaching quality. While there was evidence that this approach would increase enrollment it was known that such supply policies were not effective for increasing enrollment amongt the poor. So Santiago Levy took a household demand approach providing subsidies which can administratively targeted to the poor and thereby perhaps help increase the enrollment rates in these groups. But would this work?</p>
<p>To find out the ministry of Finance conducted a randomized controlled trial on a set of villages, selecting some of them at random for receiving Progresa benefits. To provide additional incentives for child enrollment the transfers were conditioned on whether children attended school regularly and the family used preventive health care. More money was given to children in secondary school than to children in primary school to compensate for lost wages (from going to school rather than taking up paid work) and also more money was given for enroling girls than for enroling boys.</p>
<p>Through the selection of all potentially eligible households based on geographical and household poverty information all of these households share similar characteristics. The random allocation of Progresa recipients splits this population into a treatment group (the Progresa recipients) and a control group ( the households which did not receive Progresa transfers). If the groups are then compared with respect to enrollment rates we can say that they are similar in all dimensions except treatment. Differences in enrollment rates between the groups can then be understood as causally linked to the treatment. There is no confounding. This is the basic idea of a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>It could indeed be established that Progresa worked to increase school enrollment among the poor in Mexico. Here are the numbers: For boys the enrollment increased from 73 % in the control group to 77 % in the Progresa group. For girls the increase was even bigger, from 67 % in the contril group to 75 % in the Progresa group.</p>
<p>The evidence for the success of the Progresa Program also helped that the program survived when political power was transferred to a new government in the next election. Although Santiago Levy was not prime minister any more, the new government continued the program under the new name Oppordunitades.</p>

<li>The polio vaccine studies were conducted only in certain experimental areas (school districts) selected by the Public Health Service in consultation with local officials. In these areas there were about 3 million children in grades 1,2, or 3; and there were about 11 million children in those grades in the United States. In the experimental areas, the incindence of polio was about 25% higher than in the rest of the country. Did the vaccine field trial cause children to get polio instead of preventing it?

<h2 data-number="5.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="observational-studies"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Observational studies</h2>
<p>Controlled experiments are different from <strong>observational</strong> studies. In a controlled experiment the investigator decides who will be in the treatment group and who will be in the control group. In an observational study, by contrast, the investigator can just observe what happens and he has no control over assigning subjects to different groups. In an observational study the subjects assign themselves to treatment and control.</p>
<p>This terminology can be confusing because it uses the word control in two meanings: On the one hand, as we discussed in the previous sections a control is a subject who did not get the treatment. A controlled experiment is a study where the investigator decides who will be in the treatment group and who will be in the control group.</p>
<p>Going back to studies on the effects of smoking, which we discussed earlier in this lecture, we can see that such studies must necessarily be observational. We can not make some people smoke for a decade or more just to fulfill a statistically satisfactory research design.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the basic idea of treatment and control groups is still used. The statistician in an observational study on the effects of smoking would compare the smokers - the treatment group with exposure to smoking - with the non-smokers, the control group. The idea is that we can learn something about the effects from smoking by such a comparison.</p>
<p>In this comparison, in the many observational studies that have been done on smoking since the early 20th century, smokers come out pretty badly. They suffer more frequently than non-smokers from heart attacks, lung cancer and other diseases. If smoking would cause these higher rates, this would explain the correlation observed in the data of the observational studies.</p>
<p>However, observing this association, is incomplete as a proof for causation. There might be a hidden factor, not included in the observational study, which makes people smoke and at the same time makes people ill.&nbsp;Such hidden factors are called <strong>confounding factors</strong> or <strong>confounders</strong> in the technical jargon of statisticians.</p>
<p>To think about potential problems of confounding, it is helpful to ask yourselve how the controls were selected. The question is whether the control group is really similar to the treatment group apart from the exposure of interest. If there is confounding something has to be done to deal with it. Statisticians often talk about controlling for confounding factors in an observational study. This is yet another, a third sense in which the word control is used in statistics.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term control in this case is that in the case where subjects differ among themselves in an observational study in crucial ways beside treatment, the statistician adjusts the sample by comparing smaller and more homogemous groups.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>A famous example illustrating this point and featured in many textbooks<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is an observational study on sex bias in admission to graduate studies at the University of California in Berkeley in the 1975. During the study period, 8442 men and 4321 women applied for admission to graduate school. The acceptance rate among men was 44 % and that of women 35 %.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I follow here the discussion in the textbook by <span class="citation" data-cites="FrePisPur2009">Freedman, Pisani, and Purves (<a href="references.html#ref-FrePisPur2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> pp.&nbsp;18-19</p></li></div></div>
<p>Assuming that men and women overall were equally well qualified this difference in the admission rate looks like evidence of a different treatment of men and women.</p>
<p>Since each subject did its own admission to graduate studies, the university should have been able to identify the subjects which discriminated against women. But at that point a puzzle appeared. If subjects were looked at seperately subject by subject there didn’t seem to be any bias against women.If there was a bias it was a bias against men. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Over a hundred subjects were involved. However, the six largest together accounted for over one-third of the total number of applicants. The pattern for these subjects was typical of the whole campus.</p>
<p>These are the data for men:</p>

<p>In each subject, the percentage of female applicants who were admitted is roughly equal to the percentage of male applicants. Subject A is an exception. It appears to discriminate against men because it admitted 82 % of the women and only 62 % of the men. The subject that looks most biased against women is E. But the difference here is only 4 percentage points. When we take all six subjects together they admitted 44% of the male applicants and only 30 % of the females. The difference amounts to 14 percentage points.</p>
<p>There is, however an explanation for this seemingly paradox situation. The first two subjects A and B were easy to get into. Over 50% of men applied to these two subjects. The other four were much harder to get into. Over 90% of the women applied to these subjects.</p>
<p>This means that men applied to the easy subjects whereas women applied for the hard ones. there was a confounding effect. The effect due to the choice of subject was confounded with the effect due to sex. When the choice of the subject is controlled for there is little difference between admission rates of men and women.</p>
<p>This is known as <strong>Simpson’s paradox</strong> which occurs when the apparent direction of an association is reversed by adjusting for a confounding factor.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">Spiegelhalter (<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> discusses a list of criteria first suggested by the British applied statistician Austin Bradford Hill in 1965. These criteria should be considered before concluding that an observed link between an outcome and an exposure was causal. These criteria were much debated and we show here a version of the list presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">Spiegelhalter (<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> and which is due to Jermey Howick - a clinical epidemiologist form the University of Oxford in the UK - and his colleagues.</p>
<p>These criteria are separated in three categories: Direct, mechanistic and parallel evidence. I reproduce the list from the book of <span class="citation" data-cites="Spi2019">Spiegelhalter (<a href="references.html#ref-Spi2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct evidence
<ul>
<li>The size of the effect is so large that it can not be explained by plausible confounding.</li>
<li>There is an appropriate temporaö and/or spatial proximity, in that cause precedes effect and effect occurs after a plausible interval and/or cause occurs at the same site as the effect.</li>
<li>The effect increases as the exposure increases and the effect reduces upon reduction in exposure (dose responsiveness and reversibility).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mechanistic evidence
<ul>
<li>There is a plausible mechanism of action which could be biological, chemical or mechanical with external evidence fro a causal chain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Parallel evidence
<ul>
<li>The effect fits with what is known already</li>
<li>The effect is also found when the study is replicated</li>
<li>The effect is found in similar, but not identical studies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The appropriate handling of causation is still a contested field of statistics. There are various techniques that are based on the idea to use certain techniques to bring an observational study as close as possible to the situation of a randomized controlled experiment. All these techniques adjust in more or less sophisticated ways for potential confounders. Most of these techniques are based on regression, a topic we study later in this course. Whatever sophisticated technique is used judgement is always required if causation is claimed.</p>
