# From limited data to populations

In the last exercise we analyzed data from the Demographic and Health Survey.^[To learn more about this survey, please visit the DHS website at https://dhsprogram.com/] We looked at data 
monitoring of the nutritional state of children by using anthropometric data.Â¶

The data allow for producing tables like - for example - the following from the DHS model
data set we also used for an exercise in the previous section.
```{r}
library(JWL)
data  <- children_nutrition_data

stunting_by_region <- by(data, data$region, with, weighted.mean(nt_ch_stunt, wt)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2)
wasting_by_region <-  by(data, data$region, with, weighted.mean(nt_ch_wast, wt)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2) 

tab <- data.frame(Region = c("Region 1", "Region 2", "Region 3", "Region 4"),
                             Stunted = stunting_by_region, Wasted = wasting_by_region)
knitr::kable(tab, caption = "Percentage of stunted and wasted children by Region")
```
These percentages are calculated from measurements of 2494 observations. 
Now even a small region in a thinly populated area will have more children than
that. For instance the tiny European state of Liechtenstein, a small 62 square miles sliver of land
between Austria and Switzerland has currently about 38.000 inhabitants. To a rough approximation even there
the number of children under 59 month - the group for which the anthropometric measurments of the DHS were taken -
is about this size or larger.

The data of the demographic and health survey are collected by selecting some households in a country and
asking them questions to their members or by taking measurements from them.
Surveys are huge and expensive projects which require complex logistics to work properly.
The researchers in such a project are not interested
in what particular respondents say or what are their particular anthropometric data are. In fact the
individual respondents are anonymous in the collected data set. The questions are asked to find
overall patterns in - for example - the nutritional status of children and infants in a country
or in an administrative region.

But how can we say something about such a pattern in a country or a
region by just asking a group of people or by taking some measurements from them? How can we be
confident about the results beyond just claiming that we can generalize from the data of people
we asked to the population pattern we are ultimately interested in? How can we ask or
measure people in a way that the analysis of data from this subset allows to learn something
about these measures in the entire population? 

In this chapter we discuss how such a seemingly
magical generalization can work at all and what needs to be considered before making such 
sweeping generalizations with some level of confidence.

The process of going from responses or measurements in a survey to patterns in a country or region
proceeds in four stages as explained in @Spi2019. We follow here his four stages taking the
he DHS as an example. 

Stage 1:

In the first stage of the data collection process the DHS a group of
households is selected from the larger population about which we want to learn 
something. In technical
terms the selected group is called a **sample** and the larger population about we
ultimately hope to learn something is called the **target population**. The sample
and all the successful and failed measurements in the sample will give us the
**raw data**. From this we can get information about ...

Stage 2:

The **true** numbers of height and weight in our sample, which contains
information about ...

Stage 3:

The height and weight in the **study population**, the people that could have potentially
been included in the survey, which contains information about ...

Stage 4: 

The height and weight of children in our **target population**.

It is important to understand that at all these stages errors can occur. 

For example
on the way from the raw data to our sample - the step from stage 1 to stage 2 -
we have to make assumptions on how accurately
the field workers have taken their height and weight measurements. Or if we ask questions, 
we need to make assumptions on how accurately people respond. 

When we go from the sample to the study population - from stage 2 to stage 3 - we need to
be confident that the people asked or measured are a **random sample** from those who could be
asked in principle. We have not yet introduced probability and what we mean exactly with 
a random sample. But at this stage it is sufficient to rely on our intuitive understanding
of what random means and why it is important. Assume the sample had not been selected at random. Say
the DHS survey team would drive through a region and stop here and there to interview households. This
method risks that some households are much more likely to be in the sample than others - for example the 
ones who are easy to reach on the road. Then in going from 2 to 3 we will make mistakes because we will
measure using a sample that is not comparable to the study population. Even worse we can not even quantify the
error we are making.

Now if a survey is done properly and professionally, as we can be confident with the DHS, this is
something we can usually assume. But even then we need to assume that the people who agree to take
part in the survey, those in our sample that cooperate with the survey team, i.e. answer questions, 
agree to have anthropocentric measurements taken of their children, are representative. Otherwise
comparisons with the larger group about which we ultimately want to say something, will be problematic.
Assuring that the people in the sample who cooperate are representative is more difficult to assure.
There are methods and procedures to address this difficulty systematically. For the moment it is 
important for you to recognize this as a potential source of error.

When we assume that the people who could potentially have been asked to participate in the survey
represent the population of a country or a region, then the last step - going from stage 3 to stage 4 - 
is more straightforward. If the sample has been chosen with sufficient care this will be
possible. It is, however, not easy in practice.

Considering all these potential sources of error you might become sceptical whether it is
possible to say something reliable at all. The good news is that statistics as a science and the
methods you are going to learn during this course can smooth and control the process of
going through these four steps where you indeed can say something very reliable and you
can even precisely quantify the uncertainty that remains in what you are saying. 


## Learning from data and the process of inductive inference.

In the preceding chapters we have looked at examples where we had given data. Analysis of this
data was sufficient if we just appropriately summarized them or displayed the data in an
insightful way.

Sometimes this is really all there is to do. For instance when we studies the time trend in
extreme world poverty we just looked at the time series of the share of people in the world
who have to live on an income of below 1.90 $ a day and a plot showed us the complete answer.
The data show a steady decrease since 2000 starting from a share of roughly 27 % down to a share
below 10 % in 2017.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(JWL)

demo_data <- povdat_by_country

names(demo_data) <- c("Country", "Code", "Year", "Share")

pl_dat <- with(demo_data, demo_data[Country == "World" & Year >= 2000, ])

p <- ggplot(pl_dat, aes(x = Year, y = Share)) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_line() +
     xlab("") +
     ylab("Share of extreme poverty in percent")

p
```

But sometimes we want to say more about the data. We would like - for instance - to make
predictions on how, for example, the trend in this share is going to look like in the future
where we do not yet have data. Remember Figure 1.2 in section 1, where we showed three such predictions
that were made then for 2021.
![Predictions of extreme poverty share](figures/fig-share-of-people-in-extreme-poverty-world-forecast.png)
Or maybe we would like to say something more basic. For example why is the share predicted to rise after so
many years?

Such generalisations, where we try to learn something about the world outside of our observations, based on these
observations are called in statistics **inductive inference**. Inductive inference is challenging idea and it had
been the topic of many philosophical amd methodological controversies among scholars in the past.

Deductive reasoning derives particular conclusions from general premises using the rules of logic.
In this way if the assumptions hold and the reasoning is done correctly, i.e. the rules of logic are
properly applied the conclusions is certain and irrefutable. A toy example of deductive reasoning would for
instance be:

Major Premise: All plants perform photoynthesis.
Minor Premise: A cactus is a plant.
Conclusion: A cactus performs photosynthesis.

Modern mathematical reasoning is all built on deduction, allowing to come up with 
actual proofs of certain statements given a set of axioms or assumptions. A proof is 
possible because deduction is logically certain.

Inductive reasoning works differently. It starts from particular instances and tries to work out
generalisations from there. It goes from data to hypothesis. A simple toy example for inductive
reasoning would be:

Data: I see fireflies in my garden every summer.
Hypothesis: This summer I will probably see fireflies in my garden.

Induction does not allows to proof a hypothesis because it is generally uncertain.

Let us go back to the entire process of going from the raw data to the statements about the
entire country or region in the DHS survey. 

When we go from the sample to the true data about the units in the sample, the step from stage 1 to
stage 2, we have to think careful about issues or problems of measurement. We want to know
whether our data are reliable. They should have a low variability from occasion to occasion and
should measure the same thing when we repeat a measurement. They should also measure what we intend or
want to measure. This is called validity. We do not want our data to have a systematic bias.

When we take again the DHS as an example, where people are asked many questions and quite a few
measurements are taken on individuals, questions should be such that people give the same or a similar 
answer each time they are asked this question. To some extend this can be tested but these tests are not
perfect. We also need to assume that people answer honestly to questions. With measurements things are
similar. We want that we get the same or a very similar result if we repeat a measurement and we need to
assume that the survey field workers who take the measurements do their job diligently. 

If questions would be biased towards a particular answer a survey would also not be valid. This needs
special care in developing questions. In lecture 1 we have learned about framing effects. Framing
effects are often used in marketing. For example in meat packaging it is well known that how
you report certain facts about the packaged meat influences sales. If the same piece of meat is
one time packaged with the text "75 % lean meat" and with the text "25 % fat", which is logically
the same information, several studies showed that on average the first package is preferred. This and
other details have to be considered when elicting information from the sample.

Now going from the second stage - from the sample - to the third stage - the study population requires
particular care. We have to be confident that the sample observed accurately reflects characteristics of
the larger group we are ultimately interested in and from which the sample has been taken. Technically this
is also often called **internal validity**.

Here we come to a crucial idea how bias can be avoided, the idea of **random sampling**. Let us explain exactly
what a random sample is. Using R will support us in developing this understanding. As an example
data set of our population we use as an illustration in the following discussion, let us take the
dataset on the height and weight of adult humans, we used in the previous section.
```{r}
library(JWL)
dat <- socr_height_weight
dat$Height <- dat$Height*2.54
dat$Weight <- dat$Weight*0.4535924
```
Remember that this was a data set with 25.000 observations and three variables, an index for each individual a number of height in cm and weight in kg.^[Note that the original data set `socr_height_weight` measures height in inches and weight in lbs. To get cm from inches, we have to multiply by 2.54 and to get kg from lbs we have to multiply the numbers by 0.4535924. In the data we use here we use units of cm and kg]. Let's look at the first
10 rows in this dataset.
```{r}
show <- head(dat, n= 10)
rownames(show) <- NULL
knitr::kable(head(show, n= 10))
```
Each row of this table represents an individual. Each individual here is an adult person age 18 or
more for which a measure of height and weight has been taken. So if we sample from the rows of this
table, we get values for the index, the height and the weight of individuals.

We could now take samples of rows from the table by selecting every 50th row. Here is a way
of how we could implement this in R. If you go back to our last section and remember what we
have learned about subsetting, you might get an idea how to approach such a problem.

Let us first create a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and going until the last row in steps of
length 5. This can be done without problems because 25000 rows are divisible by 50 and this procedure will
select exactly 500 rows. Here is the R code:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
idx <- seq(from = 1, to = nrow(dat), by = 5)
sample_1 <- dat[idx, ]
rownames(sample_1) <- NULL
knitr::kable(head(sample_1, n = 5))
```
Let me explain. `seq()` is an R function which creates a regular sequence of numbers. The arguments specify
where the sequence begins and where it ends as well as the step length it takes. We write this sequence
into a variable `idx`. Since we do not want row names we delete these. Then we apply the subsetting 
rules we have learned in the last section to select
all rows with index `idx` with all its variables.

While this is a sample from our population, this is not a random sample because there
is no chance involved in selecting the rows. Random sampling is a sampling method 
that uses a random mechanism. This means that the probability of each unit in the
population to become part of the sample is known.

We have not yet discussed the concept of probability. We will learn about probability later in the
course. But we have all am intuitive notion of probability from simple games of chance, such as from
rolling a die. If we throw a die the probability of each of the points - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 - showing up
is $\frac{1}{6}$. When we can give a probability for each outcome of throwing a die, we have
a probability distribution, which is in this particular example very simple. The probability of each number
showing up is the same, $\frac{1}{6}$. We can show this in the form of a bar-plot, where each bar stands for
an outcome and its height showing the probability of this outcome.
```{r}
outc <- rep(1/6,6)
barplot(names.arg = 1:6, outc, xlab = "Face", ylab = "Probability", ylim=range(pretty(c(0, outc))))
```
In contrast to this theoretical probability distribution and empirical distribution is the
distribution of observed data. We encountered many such distributions in the previous sections
and summarized them graphically be histograms. 




<!-- ## How does the DHS sample its data -->

<!-- DHS is a nationally representative, population based cross sectional household survey. The survey is representative at the -->
<!-- national level, for urban and rural areas and for the first administrative subunit. -->

<!-- population based: data are collected through interviews of a representative sample of  -->
<!-- households. Interviewers visit selcetd households, collecting data from the household. -->

<!-- cross-sectional: A snapshot of an area at a particular point in time. -->

<!-- first government level below the national unit, such as region, state or zone -->

<!-- target population: women and men of reproductive age (15-49) of all backgrounds -->

<!-- 4 stages in the DHS survey process: -->

<!-- Stage 1 survey design and questionnaire six months -->
<!-- Stage 2 training interviewers and collecting data 6 month -->
<!-- Stage 3 data editing, tabulation and report writing 1 year -->
<!-- Stage 4 Dissemination and analysis 6-7 months -->
