# From limited data to populations

In the last exercise of section 3 we analyzed data from the Demographic and Health Survey.^[To learn more about this survey, please visit the DHS website at https://dhsprogram.com/] We looked at data 
monitoring of the nutritional state of children by using anthropometric data.Â¶

The data allow for producing tables like - for example - the following from the DHS model
data set showing the share of children that are stunted and wasted by region. 
```{r}
library(JWL)
data  <- children_nutrition_data

stunting_by_region <- by(data, data$region, with, weighted.mean(nt_ch_stunt, wt)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2)
wasting_by_region <-  by(data, data$region, with, weighted.mean(nt_ch_wast, wt)) |> as.numeric() |> round(2) 

tab <- data.frame(Region = c("Region 1", "Region 2", "Region 3", "Region 4"),
                             Stunted = stunting_by_region, Wasted = wasting_by_region)
knitr::kable(tab, caption = "Percentage of stunted and wasted children by Region")
```
These percentages are calculated from measurements of 2494 observations. 
Now even a small region in a thinly populated area will have more children than
that. For instance the tiny European state of Liechtenstein, a small 62 square miles sliver of land
between Austria and Switzerland has currently about 38.000 inhabitants. To a rough approximation even there
the number of children under 59 month - the group for which the anthropometric measurments of the DHS were taken -
is about this size or larger.

The data of the demographic and health survey are collected by selecting some households in a country and
asking questions to their members or by taking measurements from them. This process of asking and measuring 
not the whole population but a subset of it is called a **survey**.

Surveys are huge and expensive projects which require complex logistics to work properly.
The researchers in such a project are not interested
in what particular respondents say or what are their particular anthropometric data are. In fact the
individual respondents are anonymous in the collected data set. The questions are asked to find
overall patterns in - for example - the nutritional status of children and infants in a country
or in an administrative region.

But how can we say something about such a pattern in a country or a
region by just asking a group of people or by taking some measurements from them? How can we be
confident about the results beyond just claiming that we can generalize from the data of people
we asked to the population pattern we are ultimately interested in? How can we ask or
measure people in a way that the analysis of data from this subset allows to learn something
about these measures in the entire population? 

In this section we discuss how such a seemingly
magical generalization can work at all and what needs to be considered before making such 
sweeping generalizations with some level of confidence. We will not learn here exactly how survey, like the DHS are done but use the survey example to introduce you to some general ideas ans principles of going from
statements about a subgroup in a population, a **sample**, to the population as a whole.

The process of going from responses or measurements in a survey to patterns in a country or region
proceeds in four stages as explained in @Spi2019. We follow here his four stages taking the
he DHS as an example. 

Stage 1:

In the first stage of the data collection process DHS selects a group of
households from the larger population about which we want to learn 
something. In technical
terms the selected group is called a **sample** and the larger population about we
ultimately hope to learn something is called the **target population**. The sample
and all the successful and failed measurements in the sample will give us the
**raw data**. From this we can get information about ...

Stage 2:

The **true** numbers of height and weight in our sample, which contains
information about ...

Stage 3:

The height and weight in the **study population**, the people that could have potentially
been included in the survey, which contains information about ...

Stage 4: 

The height and weight of children in our **target population**.

It is important to understand that at all these stages errors can occur. 

For example
on the way from the raw data to our sample - the step from stage 1 to stage 2 -
we have to make assumptions on how accurately
the field workers have taken their height and weight measurements. Or if we ask questions, 
we need to make assumptions on how accurately people respond. 

When we go from the sample to the study population - from stage 2 to stage 3 - we need to
be confident that the people asked or measured are a **random sample** from those who could be
asked in principle. We have not yet introduced probability and what we mean exactly with 
a random sample. But at this stage it is sufficient to rely on our intuitive understanding
of what random means and why it is important. Assume the sample had not been selected at random. Say
the DHS survey team would drive through a region and stop here and there to interview households. This
method risks that some households are much more likely to be in the sample than others - for example the 
ones who are easy to reach on the road. Then in going from 2 to 3 we will make mistakes because we will
measure using a sample that is not comparable to the study population. Even worse we can not even quantify the
error we are making.

![Random Sample](pictures/random_sample.png)

Now if a survey is done properly and professionally, as we can be confident with the DHS, we can 
usually assume that a proper random sample has been chosen. But even then we need to assume that the people who agree to take
part in the survey, those in our sample that cooperate with the survey team, i.e. answer questions, 
agree to have anthropometrric measurements taken of their children, are representative. Otherwise
comparisons with the larger group about which we ultimately want to say something, will be problematic.
Assuring that the people in the sample who cooperate are representative is more difficult to assure.
There are methods and procedures to address this difficulty systematically. For the moment it is 
important for you to recognize this as a potential source of error.

When we assume that the people who could potentially have been asked to participate in the survey
represent the population of a country or a region, then the last step - going from stage 3 to stage 4 - 
is more straightforward. If the sample has been chosen with sufficient care this will be
possible. It is, however, not easy in practice.

Considering all these potential sources of error you might become skeptical whether it is
possible to say something reliable from limited data about the population at all. 
The good news is that statistics as a science and the
methods you are going to learn during this course can smooth and control the process of
going through these four steps where you indeed can say something very reliable and you
can even precisely quantify the uncertainty that remains in what you are saying.

### Now you try

1. Assume a farmer wants to know the average yield of some crop - say maize - in a particular region.
He cannot measure the yield on each and every field. So he takes a sample. Taking the notions
we have explained in the previous discussion, in this example describe in words what precisly is 
the sample, what is the target population, what is the study population?

2. Suppose you are a an official statistician in the ministry of education in your country and the minister wants
to learn about the avergage performance of students on a standardized test in your countries. Again, assume it is
not possible to test all students but only a sample. Taking the notions
we have explained in the previous discussion, in this example describe in words what precisly is 
the sample, what is the target population, what is the study population?

3. Finally, assume you are the head of a firm and you would like to know the average level of customer satisfaction among your customers. You cannot ask all your customers but only a sample. Explain the meaning of the
notions in this context, what is the sample, what is the study population and what is the target population?

## Learning from data and the process of inductive inference.

In the preceding chapters we have looked at examples where we had given data. Analysis of this
data was sufficient if we just appropriately summarized them or displayed the data in an
insightful way.

Sometimes this is really all there is to do. For instance when we studied the time trend in
infant mortality we just looked at the time series of mortality data and a plot showed us the complete answer.
The data we previously plotted for Ghana and Kenya - for example - show a steady decrease since 1965 starting from a share of roughly 12 % down below 2 % in 2020. These are data from public registers and not samples. The data
are based on a complete set of observations in a country. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(JWL)

pl_dat <- with(infant_mortality_data, infant_mortality_data[Country %in% c("Ghana","Kenya") & 
                                                            Year >= 1965, ])

p <- ggplot(pl_dat, aes(x = Year, y = Mortality, color = Country)) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_line() +
     xlab("") +
     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

p
```

But sometimes we want to say more about the data. We would like - for instance - to make
predictions on how, for example, the trend in this share is going to look like in the future
where we do not yet have data. 

Or maybe we would like to say something more basic. For example why did the share show a long term 
downward trend in those countries. 

Such generalisations, where we try to learn something about the world outside of our observations, based on these
observations are called in statistics **inductive inference**. Inductive inference is a 
challenging idea and it had
been the topic of many philosophical and methodological controversies among scholars in the past.

**Deductive reasoning** derives particular conclusions from general premises using the rules of logic.
In this way if the assumptions hold and the reasoning is done correctly, i.e. the rules of logic are
properly applied the conclusions is certain and irrefutable. A toy example of deductive reasoning would for
instance be:

- Major Premise: All plants perform photosynthesis.
- Minor Premise: A cactus is a plant.
- Conclusion: A cactus performs photosynthesis.

Modern mathematical reasoning is all built on deduction, allowing to come up with 
actual proofs of certain statements given a set of axioms or assumptions. A proof is 
possible because deduction is logically certain.

**Inductive reasoning** works differently. It starts from particular instances and tries to work out
generalizations from there. It goes from data to hypothesis. A simple toy example for inductive
reasoning would be:

- Data: I see fireflies in my garden every summer.
- Hypothesis: This summer I will probably see fireflies in my garden.

Induction does not allow to proof a hypothesis because it is generally uncertain.

### Now you try
Think of another example for 

1. deductive reasoning 

2. inductive reasoning.

:::

Let us go back to the entire process of going from the raw data to the statements about the
entire country or region in the DHS survey. 

When we go from the sample to the true data about the units in the sample, the step from stage 1 to
stage 2, we have to think careful about issues or problems of measurement. We want to know
whether our data are reliable. They should have a low variability from occasion to occasion and
should measure the same thing when we repeat a measurement. They should also measure what we intend or
want to measure. This is called validity. We do not want our data to have a systematic bias.

Here is the idea of a random in a stylized picture. The big circle is the frame for the population from which
you take a sample. The unit of obervation in the DHS and in this example is a household. The read households
are picked at random from the population and put into the sample.

When we take again the DHS as an example, where people are asked many questions and quite a few
measurements are taken on individuals, questions should be such that people give the same or a similar 
answer each time they are asked this question. To some extend this can be tested but these tests are not
perfect. We also need to assume that people answer honestly to questions. With measurements things are
similar. We want that we get the same or a very similar result if we repeat a measurement and we need to
assume that the survey field workers who take the measurements do their job diligently. 

If questions would be biased towards a particular answer a survey would also not be valid. This needs
special care in developing questions. In chapter 2 we have learned about framing effects. Framing
effects are often used in marketing. For example in meat packaging it is well known that how
you report certain facts about the packaged meat influences sales. If the same piece of meat is
one time packaged with the text "75 % lean meat" and the other time with the text "25 % fat", which is logically
the same information, several studies showed that on average the first package is preferred. This and
other details have to be considered when elicting information from the sample.

Now going from the second stage - from the sample - to the third stage - the study population requires
particular care. We have to be confident that the sample observed accurately reflects characteristics of
the larger group we are ultimately interested in and from which the sample has been taken. Technically this
is also often called **internal validity**.

Here we come to a crucial idea how bias can be avoided, the idea of **random sampling**. Let us explain exactly
what a random sample is. Using R will support us in developing this understanding. As an example
data set of our population we use as an illustration in the following discussion, let us take the
dataset on the height and weight of adult humans, we used in chapter 3.

## Why does random sampling help avoiding bias?

```{r}
library(JWL)
dat <- socr_height_weight
dat$Height <- dat$Height*2.54
dat$Weight <- dat$Weight*0.4535924
```
Remember that this was a data set with 25.000 observations and three variables, an index for each individual a number of height in cm and weight in kg.^[Note that the original data set `socr_height_weight` measures height in inches and weight in lbs. To get cm from inches, we have to multiply by 2.54 and to get kg from lbs we have to multiply the numbers by 0.4535924. In the data we use here we use units of cm and kg]. Let's look at the first
10 rows in this dataset.
```{r}
show <- head(dat, n= 10)
rownames(show) <- NULL
knitr::kable(head(show, n= 10))
```
Each row of this table represents an individual. Each individual here is an adult person age 18 or
more for which a measure of height and weight has been taken. So if we sample from the rows of this
table, we get values for the index, the height and the weight of individuals.

We could now take samples of rows from the table by selecting every 50th row. Here is a way
of how we could implement this in R. If you go back to our last section and remember what we
have learned about subsetting, you might get an idea how to approach such a problem.

Let us first create a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and going until the last row in steps of
length 5. This can be done without problems because 25000 rows are divisible by 50 and this procedure will
select exactly 500 rows. Here is the R code:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
idx <- seq(from = 1, to = nrow(dat), by = 5)
sample_1 <- dat[idx, ]
rownames(sample_1) <- NULL
knitr::kable(head(sample_1, n = 5))
```
Let me explain. `seq()` is an R function which creates a regular sequence of numbers. The arguments specify
where the sequence begins and where it ends as well as the step length it takes. We write this sequence
into a variable `idx`. Since we do not want row names we delete these. Then we apply the subsetting 
rules we have learned in the last section to select
all rows with index `idx` with all its variables.

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try
You can try this code yourself and apply it to another situation where you would for example select
every 100th obervation in the dataframe.

:::

While this is a sample from our population, this is not a random sample because there
is no chance involved in selecting the rows. Random sampling is a sampling method 
that uses a random mechanism. This means that the probability of each unit in the
population to become part of the sample is known.

### A virtual game of chance: Rolling a die

We have not yet discussed the concept of probability. We will learn about probability later in the
course. But we have all am intuitive notion of probability from simple games of chance, such as from
rolling a die. If we throw a die the probability of each of the points shown on the die's faces 
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 - is $\frac{1}{6}$. This is the chance or probability we would attribute
before throwing the die that it shows a particular number. 
When we can give a probability for each outcome of throwing a die, we have
a probability distribution, which is in this particular example very simple, because the
probability we have attributed to the different outcomes is always $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability of each number
showing up is the same, $\frac{1}{6}$. We can show this in the form of a bar-plot, where each bar stands for
an outcome and its height showing the probability of this outcome.
```{r}
die_out <- c(rep(1,10), rep(2,10), rep(3,10),rep(4,10), rep(5,10), rep(6,10))

# create a histogram with 6 columns
hist(die_out, 
     breaks = seq(0.5, 6.5, by = 1), 
     col = "lightblue",  
     freq = FALSE,
     xlab = "Face", 
     ylab = "Percent per unit", 
     main = "Probability Distribution Fair Die",
     axes = F)         

# add labels below each column
axis(1, at = 1:6, labels = 1:6)
axis(2, at =c(0,0.08, 0.16), labels = c("0 %", "8 %", "16 %"))


```
In contrast to this theoretical probability distribution an empirical distribution is the
distribution of observed data. We encountered many such distributions in the previous sections
and and we have learned how to summarize them graphically by histograms.

The computer allows us to create empirical distributions of results from 
throwing a virtual die. It is a simulation of a real situation where you would 
actually roll a six sided die physically. 

This is an example which allows us to 
introduce some new functions and concepts in R, which we will need in the rest of the
course.

First we create a virtual die by defining an appropriate R object. This die
should represent a physical die, which you know from games of chance.

![A die](pictures/die_picture.jpg){width=50% height=50%}

The essential 
feature of the die is that it has six faces each showing different points
starting from 1 to 6. In R we implement this by creating a vector of integers 1 to 6, like this
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

die <- 1:6
```

Here we have created the vector of integers 1,2,3,4,5,6 and saved these numbers in an object calles `die`.

Now R has a built in function, called `sample()` which can pick values at random from an object. We can tell
R by using this function for instance that it should randomly pick a number from the six possible numbers of
`die`. 

This is how it works:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

sample(x=die, size = 1)
```

The R-function `sample()` takes an object as argument. The second argument, called `size`, specifies the number of
random picks or draws from the object. If we give the value 1 to `size` it is as if we threw the die once. We have
now implemented in the computer an equivalent to physically throwing a die.

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try
In the stylized picture of a random sample, we had 24 households in the population from which we randomly
picked a sample of 8. Use the sample function to pick randomly 8 numbers out of the numbers 1 to 24.

:::

One feature that makes R so very powerful is that you can not only use built in functions, like `mean`, `hist` `sample` etc. but you can also write your own functions. We could for instance write a function which rolls
a die if we call it.

### A brief digression: Writing R functions yourself

Each function in R has the same elements: A **name**, a **function body** of code and a set of **arguments**. 
To write your own function, you have to write up all of these parts and save them in an R object. 

The syntax is given like this:

`my_function <- function() {}`

The name here is `my_function`, next comes the expression `function()` which needs to be assigned. The names of the function arguments have to be written between the parentheses. Then we have to write the actual code within the braces `{}`.

To do this for the die, lets write a function named `roll_die`

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die <- function(){die <- 1:6 
                         sample(die, size = 1)}
```

Now we have written the function and saved it as an R-object we can call it like this. Let's
call it three times for example:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die()
roll_die()
roll_die()
```

Note that in our function `roll_die()` has no arguments, just the function body. This is
perfectly legitimate in R. It is important that when we call the function we have to call it
with the parenthesis like `roll_die()`. If we only call the name `roll_die`, R will display the
code in the function body.

Congratulations ! You have written your first R function for conducting a simple random
experiment. Let me remind you once again: Think of the parentheses as a 
trigger that tells R to run the function. If
you omit the trigger R just prints the body of the function. When you run a function,
all the code in the function body is executed and R returns the result of the last
line of code. If the last line of code does not return a value neither will R.

Let me finally say a few things about **arguments** in a function.

Imagine we remove the first line of code in our function body and changed the name
die in the sample function to "ball".
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die2 <- function(){sample(ball, size = 1)}
```

If we call the function now, we will get an error. The function call `roll_die2()` will 
result in 
the error message `Error in sample(ball, size = 1) : object 'ball' not found` (try it!)

We could supply ball when we call `roll_die2` if we make ball an argument of the
function. Lets do this:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die2 <- function(ball){sample(ball, size = 1)}
```
Now the function will work as long as we supply `ball` when we call the function.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die2(ball = 1:6)
```
Note that we still get an error, if we forget to supply ball argument.
This could be avoided if we give the function a default argument
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die2 <- function(ball= 1:6){sample(ball, size = 1)}
```
Now if we type:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

roll_die2()
```
everything works, just as intended.

### Going back to simulating die rolls

Now we are interested in an **empirical distribution** of points if we roll the die many times. A built
in R function that would help us to do this. This function is called `replicate()`. It needs two arguments,
how many times it should do something and of course what it should do precisely. 

So if we roll our virtual die 10 times, we would tell R to do this:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

r10 <- replicate(10, roll_die())
```

which gives us the sequence of results from these 10 rolls. Now let's plot the
empirical distribution.

```{r}
hist(r10, 
     breaks = seq(0.5, 6.5, by = 1), 
     col = "lightblue",  
     freq = FALSE,
     xlab = "Face", 
     ylab = "Percent per unit", 
     main = "Probability Distribution Fair Die",
     axes = F)         

# add labels below each column
# add labels below each column
axis(1, at = 1:6, labels = 1:6)
axis(2, at =c(0,0.08, 0.16), labels = c("0 %", "8 %", "16 %"))

```
This does look quite different from the theoretical distribution, where each bar had the same length.

When we increase the sample size the empirical distribution starts to look more similar to the
theoretical distribution. Lets roll our die 100 times

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
r100 <- replicate(100, roll_die())
```

```{r}
hist(r100, 
     breaks = seq(0.5, 6.5, by = 1), 
     col = "lightblue",  
     freq = FALSE,
     xlab = "Face", 
     ylab = "Percent per unit", 
     main = "Probability Distribution Fair Die",
     axes = F)         

# add labels below each column
axis(1, at = 1:6, labels = 1:6)
axis(2, at =c(0,0.08, 0.16), labels = c("0 %", "8 %", "16 %"))
```

Looks better. What about 1000 rolls?
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
r1000 <- replicate(1000, roll_die())
```

```{r}
hist(r1000, 
     breaks = seq(0.5, 6.5, by = 1), 
     col = "lightblue",  
     freq = FALSE,
     xlab = "Face", 
     ylab = "Percent per unit", 
     main = "Probability Distribution Fair Die",
     axes = F)         

# add labels below each column
axis(1, at = 1:6, labels = 1:6)
axis(2, at =c(0,0.08, 0.16), labels = c("0 %", "8 %", "16 %"))

```

As we increase the number of rolls in the simulation, the area of each bar 
gets closer to 16.67% ($\frac{1}{6}$), which is the area of each bar in the probability histogram.

Let's do a last example with 100.000 rolls to show this

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
r100000 <- replicate(100000, roll_die())
```

```{r}
hist(r100000, 
     breaks = seq(0.5, 6.5, by = 1), 
     col = "lightblue",  
     freq = FALSE,
     xlab = "Face", 
     ylab = "Percent per unit", 
     main = "Probability Distribution Fair Die",
     axes = F)         

# add labels below each column
axis(1, at = 1:6, labels = 1:6)
axis(2, at =c(0,0.08, 0.16), labels = c("0 %", "8 %", "16 %"))

```


Now we are almost there.

### The law of averages

What we have just observed is a demonstration of a famous result of probability theory. We are going
to learn about probabilities later in the course. This result, sometimes referred to as
the law of averages.^[Technically the result is called the weak law of large numbers and was discovered by the
Mathematician Jacob Bernoulli in 1713] 

The law says that if a chance experiment - such as throwing a fair die - is repeated independently and under
identical conditions (this means that every repetition is performed in the same way regardless of the
other repetitions.), then as we repeat the experiment long enough, the relative frequency of each event  
- in our case an event would be that for example the outcome of the die throw is 1 - gets closer to the 
theoretical probability of the event. 

In the example of the die, we just studied by using the simulation capacities of R, we saw that the 
proportion that the die will land on a face showing 6 will happen in about 1/6 of all rolls.

This law also holds when a random sample is drawn from units of a large population. Let us use the 
table of heights in cm and weights in kg of 25.000 adults we studied in the last unit. Here we show
the fist 10 rows.
```{r}
library(JWL)
data <- socr_height_weight
# transfrom to metric units from inches to cm and from lbs to kg
data$Height <- data$Height*2.54
data$Weight <- data$Weight*0.4535924
head(data, n=10)
```
Let us remind ourselves, how the histogram of the height-data looked like.
```{r}
h <- hist(data$Height, 
     breaks = 30, 
     plot = F)

h$counts <- h$counts/sum(h$counts)*100

plot(h, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Percent", main = "Height distribution of adults", axes = F)
axis(1, at = c(160, 170, 180, 190), labels = c("160 cm", "170 cm", "180 cm", "190 cm"))
axis(2, at =c(0,2,4,6,8), labels = c("0 %", "2 %", "4 %", "6 %", "8 %"))
```

Let us now think about the 25.000 adults in our data as a population. We draw a random 
sample from it. When we draw from the population we draw with replacement. This means
when a particular individual is selected at one draw, it could in principle be selected 
also at the next one.

Let us write an R function for this:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

emp_distr_height <- function(n){
  
  data[sample(x = 1:nrow(data), size = n, replace = T), ]

  }
```
This function draws `n` random row from our dataframe. Note that `n` is an argument for the
function. The random draws are a dataframe with N row indices, say 10, and then
this gives the row index to the dataframe according to the subsetting rules we have learned in the
previous section `data[rowindex, ]`. Since there is no index in the second slot the entire rows will be selected.

Now in analogy to the dice example we can see, that when we increase the number of draws 
into our sample we come closer to the distribution of the population. By this mechanism 
a random sample generates a subpopulation with similar distributional properties when the sample
is large enough. How much is large enough? For this we need probability theory which we 
will encounter later in the course.

As with the die, let us start with 10 draws:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
hs10 <- emp_distr_height(10)
```

```{r}
h <- hist(hs10$Height, 
     breaks = 30, 
     plot = F)

h$counts <- h$counts/sum(h$counts)*100

plot(h, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Percent", main = "Height distribution of adults", axes = F)
axis(1, at = c(160, 170, 180, 190), labels = c("160 cm", "170 cm", "180 cm", "190 cm"))
axis(2, at =c(0,2,4,6,8), labels = c("0 %", "2 %", "4 %", "6 %", "8 %"))
```

This does not look very similar to the population distribution. 

What about a sample with size 100?

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hs100 <- emp_distr_height(100)
```


```{r}
h <- hist(hs100$Height, 
     breaks = 30, 
     plot = F)

h$counts <- h$counts/sum(h$counts)*100

plot(h, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Percent", main = "Height distribution of adults", axes = F)
axis(1, at = c(160, 170, 180, 190), labels = c("160 cm", "170 cm", "180 cm", "190 cm"))
axis(2, at =c(0,2,4,6,8), labels = c("0 %", "2 %", "4 %", "6 %", "8 %"))

```

Now lets increase to 2500, 10 % of the population.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

hs2500 <- emp_distr_height(2500)
```


```{r}
h <- hist(hs2500$Height, 
     breaks = 30, 
     plot = F)

h$counts <- h$counts/sum(h$counts)*100

plot(h, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Percent", main = "Height distribution of adults", axes = F)
axis(1, at = c(160, 170, 180, 190), labels = c("160 cm", "170 cm", "180 cm", "190 cm"))
axis(2, at =c(0,2,4,6,8), labels = c("0 %", "2 %", "4 %", "6 %", "8 %"))
```

This looks already pretty close. You should by now see what random sampling does for
the process of inductive inference. For a large enough random sample, the empirical
distribution of the sample resembles the histogram of the population with high
probability. Thus if you report summaries of the sample, like its mean and its standard deviation, you will
be close to the true values in the population. You will not be exactly there. But since the
random mechanism is based on a probability model, where the chance of each unit ending up
in the sample is known, we can quantify the uncertainty and the error we make. 

How probability arguments work more precisely, we will learn later in the course. For now this
brief discussion should have convinced you of the importance of random sampling for making inferences
from sample to population and given you an intuition how this works. As a side effect of this discussion
you have also learned how to write R functions.

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try
Use the `emp_distr_height()`function we have just written to draw a random sample of n=5000. Compute the mean
and the standard deviation of the sample distribution. Compute - or look up in chapter 3 - the mean and the
standard deviation of the population data and compare.

:::

Now that we have discussed random sampling, why it is important and how it works, let us finally discuss the last
step in the inductive inference chain, going from the study population to the target population. Even if we have a perfect random sample, it might be the case  that we were not able to ask the people who we were ultimately interested in. When we can make conclusions on the target population from the study population, we say that 
we have not only internal but also **external validity**.

@Spie2019, whom we have already cited before gives an example where this problem is particularly extreme. 
Often scientist who are ultimately interested in humans could onl study animals, as it is often the case
in pharmaceutical research. 

A bit less extreme but related is a second example @Spie2019 gives is the case of drugs tested say only on adults but it is then used also by children. These are problems which cannot entiely be solved by statistical methods but need caution and particular care and caution.

## When all data are available

While surveys are a very important instrument to learn from data about the reality we live in, not all 
data that are available to us today are surveys. Mainly by the internet and technological 
development, the omnipresence of sensors and digital devices, we have today many data 
that are not random samples or which are not based on any sampling at all.

Many data, especially from online commerce are available to platform firms and online shops, for example. The
new field of data science git a big push from the attempt to get hold of data created through interactions on the
internet and to gain information from these data.

The public sector also collects and stores lots of administrative data in a systematic manner. These are
for example data needed to run a social security or pension system, police records, health records, demographic
data, land registers and business registers, also data on crime, voters and education. These data are used for
policy making, research and statistical analysis. In this case you have all the data.

Having all the data means that the stage of the induction process where we go from a sample to a study
population collapses because the sample and the study population are the same.

Still problems can occur. @Spie2019 mentions the problem that the police systematically misses cases which the
police does not record as a crime or which have not been reported by a victim. These problems make the step of drawing conclusions from the study population to the target population difficult. It is not only police records on crimes. You have analogous problems in all other register data as well. Take population register, as one example. Often certain groups such as homeless people or undocumented immigrants who may be hesitant to register or provide personal information are under-counted. Or you can have inaccuracies in property ownership data in land registers due to incomplete or outdated records, fraudulent transactions, or illegal land occupations. Or in health registers you could have missing or incomplete data on certain health conditions, especially those that are stigmatized or poorly understood, or patients who do not seek medical attention due to lack of access or fear of discrimination.

Of course if we have all the data it is a straightforward process to produce statistics that 
describe what we have measured. But for broader conclusions we need to be very careful and we need to 
think about systematic biases and how we can potentially control for them. This always needs our 
special attention because systematic bias can jeopardize or even invalidate the reliability of our claims.

## The normal approximation for data

We will now discuss an old and powerful concept that helps us in our ultimate aim to describe the
target distribution. This is called the normal distribution or often also called the "bell curve", because of
its characteristic shape. We already encountered this distribution in the last exercise of chapter 3, when we
worked with the DHS data.

### The normal curve

The normal curve was discovered first around 1720 by Abraham de Moivre^[Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) was a French mathematician known for his contributions to the development of probability theory and the normal distribution as well as for his work on complex numbers. He is perhaps best known for his discovery of the formula that bears his name, which relates complex numbers to trigonometric functions. De Moivre was also a prominent member of the scientific community in 18th-century Europe and corresponded with many of the leading mathematicians and scientists of his time. ![Abraham de Moivre](pictures/Abraham_de_moivre.jpg)] In 1809, the German mathematician Car Friedrich Gauss^[Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including algebra, number theory, astronomy, and physics. Gauss is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and is known for his contributions to the development of calculus, the discovery of the normal distribution, and his work on the theory of functions. Gauss also made important contributions to the field of astronomy, including the discovery of the asteroid Ceres and the development of a method for calculating the orbits of celestial bodies. ![Carl Friedrich Gauss](pictures/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss_1840_by_Jensen.jpg)], made significant contributions to the concept of the normal curve, which is until today often also referred as a Gaussian curve. He used the curve to model errors in astronomical observations. Around 1870 the Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet^[Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874) was a Belgian mathematician, astronomer, and statistician who is known for his work in developing the concept of the "average man" and the use of statistical methods in the social sciences. He is also credited with the development of the body mass index (BMI), which is still widely used today as a measure of obesity. Quetelet was a prominent figure in the scientific community of his time and was a founding member of the International Statistical Institute. ![Adolphe Quetelet](pictures/Adolphe_QuÃ©telet_by_Joseph-Arnold_Demannez.jpg)] had the idea of using the curve as an
ideal histogram to which historams of empirical distributions could be compared.

The normal curve has a slightly intimidating equation, which looks as follows
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

But don't be afraid. You do not have to be able to manipulate this equation. 
This is something that R. We will learn how to do this.^[The mathematical formula for the normal curve is very interesting, since it contains the most famous numbers in mathematics. We have already encountered $\sqrt{2}$, the diagonal of the unit square, which is the first so called irrational number detected by the Pythagoreans in antiquity. For them it was quite a shock to discover that there are numbers which can not be represented as a fraction of whole numbers. There is the famous number $\pi$ also known since antiquity. This number represents the ratio of the circumference of any
circle to its diameter and is also an irrational number. Finally there is the
number $e$ or sometimes also known as Euler's number. It is the limit of the sequence $(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$ and plays a fundamental role all over mathematics.]

```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "Standard units", ylab = "Percent per standard unit", main = "The Normal Curve", col = "red")

```
There are several features of this graph that are important to note:

1. The graph is symmetric about 0. The part of the curve to the right is a mirror image of the part of the
curve to the left.
2. The total area under the curve equals 1 or 100 %. 
3. The curve is always above the horizontal axis. It appears to get equal to zero between 3 and 4 but this is
only because the distance from the horizontal axis becomes too tiny to visualize. Only about 0.00006 of the area
under the curve is outside of this interval.

It will be important and helpful to find areas under the normal curve between
specified values. For instance:

1. the area under the normal curve between +1 and - 1 standard deviations from the
mean is about 68 %.
2. the area under the normal curve between -2 and +2 standard deviations is about 95 %.
3. the area under the normal curve between -3 and +3 standard deviations is about 99.7%

Does this look familiar? If you followed the course until now, you will remember that
these are the numbers we encountered with the data on human height. This is because for these data the empirical distribution is such that the respective histogram is very closely approximated by a normal curve. 

### Units and standard units

Often it is convenient to express the units for the normal curve not in the
direct unit in which observations are measures - as for example cm for human height - but in units of standard deviations from the mean.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Conversion to standard units

A value is converted to standard units by checking how many standard deviations it is above or below the average. Values above the average are given a plus sign, values below the average are given a minus sign.
:::

Take an example from our human height data and draw 4 random values from these data, using the `emp_distr_height()` function we wrote earlier in this chapter
say
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

example <- emp_distr_height(4)
example$Height
```

Let us convert these values to standard units. Let us compute again the
mean and the standard deviation of the height data.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

m <- mean(data$Height)
std <- sd(data$Height)

m
std
```

`r round(example$Height[1],4)` is `r round((example$Height[1] - m)/std,4)` from the average. In standard units therefore `r round(example$Height[1],4)` is `r round((example$Height[1] - m)/std,4)`.

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

### Now you try
Convert the other values to standard units. Find the height which is 2.4 in standard
units.
:::

Standard units are used in the DHS data on nutrition of children and adults which
we worked with in the last exercise of chapter 3. Standard units are also
often referred to as the **z-score**. Let us go back to these data and look at
them more closely again.

Let us go back to the histogram of human height we already discussed in the chapter 3.
```{r}
h <- hist(data$Height, plot = F, breaks = 30)

 hist_breaks <- h$breaks
 color_list <- rep('#C6E2FF', length(hist_breaks))
 color_list[hist_breaks <= m + std] <- '#6C7B8B'
 color_list[hist_breaks <= m - std] <- '#C6E2FF'

par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 4) + 0.3)  
plot(h, col = color_list, freq = FALSE, xlab = " ", ylab = "Percent per cm ", main = "Height distribution of adults", axes = F)

par(new = TRUE) 
## Define x and y coordinates for normal curve
 x <- seq(min(data$Height), max(data$Height), length.out = 100)
 y <- dnorm(x, m, std)
 
# Add normal curve to histogram plot
 lines(x, y, col = "red", lwd = 2,  xlab = " ", ylab = " ")
 axis(side = 4, at =c(0,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08), labels = c("0%", "9.7 %", "19.3 %", "29.0 %", "38.6 %"))
 

axis(1, at = c(153.38, 158.21, 163.04, 167.87, 172.70, 177.53, 182.36, 187.19, 192.02), 
     labels = c("153.38 cm", "158.21 cm", "163.04 cm", "167.87 cm", "172.70 cm", "177.53 cm", "182.36 cm", "187.19 cm", "192.02 cm"))

axis(1, at = c(153.38, 158.21, 163.04, 167.87, 172.70, 177.53, 182.36, 187.19, 192.02), 
     labels = c("-4", "-3", "-2", "-1", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4"), line = 2.5)



axis(2, at =c(0,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08), labels = c("0 %", "2 %", "4 %", "6 %", "8 %"))
```

There are two x-axis in this figure. On the upper x-axis you see the height in cm. On the lower x-axis you see the height in standard units. Standard unit 1 is at 172.70 + 4.83 or at 177.53 and
standard unit -1 is at 172.70 - 4.83 or 167.87.

There are two vertical axis in this figure, one on the left and one on the right. The histogram is drawn relative to the left y-axis, which is in percent per cm. The normal curve is drawn relative to the right one. To see how the scale on the right y-axis matches up, take the top value on each of the two axes: 38.6 % per standard unit matches 8% per cm because there are 4.8 cm to the standard unit. Spreading 38.6 % over one standard deviation is the same as spreading 38.6 % over 4.8cm and that comes to 8% per cm.

We explained before that the area under the normal curve between - 1 and 1 standard deviation from the mean is 68 %. In histogram the area between these values is colored in gray. The historgam follows the normal curve very closely. Sometimes it is a bit above, sometimes a bit below the curve but these deviations balance out. Indeed, if you go back to the previous chapter you see that in the empirical distribution we have indeed 68% of observations exactly between these bounds. So the shaded area in the histogram is to a very good approximation equal to the area under the normal curve and this is where the 68 % come from.

<!-- DHS is a nationally representative, population based cross sectional household survey. The survey is representative at the -->
<!-- national level, for urban and rural areas and for the first administrative subunit. -->

<!-- population based: data are collected through interviews of a representative sample of  -->
<!-- households. Interviewers visit selcetd households, collecting data from the household. -->

<!-- cross-sectional: A snapshot of an area at a particular point in time. -->

<!-- first government level below the national unit, such as region, state or zone -->

<!-- target population: women and men of reproductive age (15-49) of all backgrounds -->

<!-- 4 stages in the DHS survey process: -->

<!-- Stage 1 survey design and questionnaire six months -->
<!-- Stage 2 training interviewers and collecting data 6 month -->
<!-- Stage 3 data editing, tabulation and report writing 1 year -->
<!-- Stage 4 Dissemination and analysis 6-7 months -->
