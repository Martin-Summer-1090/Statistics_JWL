Read the IHME data

```{r}
causes <- read.csv("../data/infant_mortality/infant-death-rates-by-cause-by-sex.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(causes) <- c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Boys", "Girls")

causes$All <- causes$Boys + causes$Girls
causes$Share <- causes$All/sum(causes$All)

# remove the superfluous Code column

causes$Code <- NULL
