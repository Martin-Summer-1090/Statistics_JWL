# **Introduction**

What is the biggest source of electricity production in Kenya? Answering 
this question needs data, listing and recording various forms of 
electricity production in specific countries. An internationally 
acknowledged organisation, which collects and reports these data 
is the International Energy Agency (IEA). If you have access to the internet,
you can look up data and reports by the IEA for instance at it's website
https://www.iea.org/, where it host a special category called *data* which you 
can look up and consult. 

Now let's take a quiz and guess. What do you think is
actually the biggest source of electricity production in Kenya?

1. Coal
2. Renewable energy
3. Natural gas

Consulting the IEA data, you will find that the correct answer 
is *renewable energy*. A very interesting website 
called *gapminder* (https://www.gapminder.org/), which analyzes the answers of
many people to this question, finds that 61 % give a wrong answer to this
question. Maybe they find it hard to imagine that 80 % of energy production in 
Kenya is already fossil free thanks to huge 
sources of geothermal and hydropower. Even if you break the answers down by
country you see that 38 % of people from Kenya get the answer wrong. Among
the people from the UK, who answer this question even 72 % answer wrongly.

If you are not familiar with some of the vocabulary used here, like 
geothermal, hydropower or even if you are not completely sure how 
to interpret a number like 38 %, don't worry. The point here is 
that you see that one useful consequence of being able to access, read and 
interpret data is that it can help to establish facts about the world and
help us to perhaps correct misconceptions we might have had about these
facts. I encourage you to visit https://www.gapminder.org/ at some occasion 
when you have access to the internet. You will be surprised how often you
might have a wrong guess about basic facts in the world.

In this course you will learn how to work with data and how to learn from these
data in a systematic way. Learning from data entails more than just establishing
facts. This might not always be possible, either because you cannot access the
relevant data or you cannot completely access them, since doing so would be
way too expensive. Think about the following interesting 
example, which I learned from a wonderful book by the British 
statistician David Spiegelhalter [@Spi2019].




Introduce the concept of statistics and give an overview what students will learn during the course. In the introductory unit I would like to include an activity on variation or an interesting visualization where students see the code (which they do not yet understand in detail) but can change certain details and experiment on the computer how the visualization changes. This will also provide a first check of whether the software and hardware work for each student. I would also like to discuss why statistics is important and get students involved by collecting data on them for use later in the course. I would like to have lots of involvement in the first unit to set expectations for plenty of participation.

The overall goals of this course might be described as follows: After successfully completing this course students will have learned new skills in three core pillars of statistics

1.  Data exploration or finding patterns in data and information through visualisation and computation.

2.  Making predictions, which means using available data and information to make informed guesses about data and information we do not have.

3.  To quantify the uncertainty we have to attach to our predictions.

Simultaneously with these three core skills the students will learn to use the computer and modern computing tools to apply this knowledge to real world data. The combination of these skills will empower students to achieve a level of data literacy allowing them to independently work with new data and new situations they encounter in their professional life after completing the course or in their further studies.

As sources for my notes I rely very much on [@FrePisPur2009] on [@Kap2009] and in particular on Spiegelhalter's wonderful exposition [@Spi2019] in terms of concepts and the logic how the concepts are developed. Important sources for examples are \[@BekKes2021\], \[@GelNol2017\] as well as [@PeCa2005] as well as [@AdhDen], who wrote the textbook for Berkeley's introductory data science course Data08.

My vision would be to achieve a suitably adapted combination of Spiegelhalter and Adhikari, DeNero and Wagner. While the former is the didactically best exposition of statistics I have ever encountered, the latter is unmatched in explaining modern computational tools at a basic level. For this course, however both sources need to be substantially reworked. Spiegelhalter is written for a general audience of readers. Here we need to teach the concepts and actively involve students through exercises and projects they do themselves. I will thus follow the conceptual development logic of Spiegelhalter -- and in this lecture note outline I have literally done so -- but I would like to find a different and more interactive exposition with perhaps also different examples, nearer to the live context of students. Adhikari, DeNero and Wagner is for this course a bit too much tilted towards computation and perhaps not enough towards statistics. On the other hand this is a lightening rod for how I would like to see this course roughly turn out in terms of exposition and the use of the computational tools, in particular notebooks and coding style.
